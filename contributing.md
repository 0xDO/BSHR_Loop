# Contributing to BSHR_Loop

We welcome and appreciate contributions from the community. Here are the ways you can contribute to the BSHR_Loop project, listed in order of preference:

## 1. Join the Discussions

Engage in discussions and conversations on the Discussions tab here on GitHub. Feel free to ask questions, make suggestions, and share your thoughts. Please abide by our C3P0 (Collaborative Culture Community Policy: Zero Tolerance) principles:

- Don't waste time
- Do no harm
- Add value

Please note that any form of trolling, rhetoric, complaints, criticism, and insults will not be tolerated and will result in an immediate and irrevocable ban. C3P0 for reference: https://github.com/daveshap/C3P0 

## 2. Create Issues

You can contribute by creating issues that are specific to the existing code. Please ensure that your issues are constructive and relevant to the project. 

We do not accept issues related to personal grievances, disagreements over theory, moving the goalposts, or complaints about scientific rigor. These behaviors are considered time-wasting and will result in issue closure and an irrevocable ban from the project.

## 3. Submit Pull Requests

High-effort, good-faith pull requests that materially and substantively add value to the project are welcome. 

Please refrain from submitting massive refactors, passive-aggressive, or low-effort requests. Stylistic or preferential changes will also be rejected.

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the BSHR_Loop project and look forward to your valuable input.
