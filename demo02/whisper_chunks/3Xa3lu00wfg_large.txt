{"text": " Happy Friday everyone as has been true every week for this year It's been an exciting week in the world of artificial intelligence and the fourth industrial revolution So today's breakdown is going to cover five main topics open AI They've got a new announcement regarding making their own chips as well as caching and a stateful API We'll unpack that in just a moment. I've also got some news about the global AI arms race heating up. There's been some really interesting developments and I'll do a kind of a deep dive analysis on that so that you kind of understand the trends that I'm seeing and that I'm paying attention to that caused me a little bit of concern. There's been some breakthrough research on senescent cells, so this is a longevity topic. We've also had some more AI breakthroughsescent cells, so this is a longevity topic. We've also had some more AI breakthroughs talking with animals, so I'll unpack that a little bit. And then finally, we will talk about ongoing job destruction around the world due to artificial intelligence. So first up is OpenAI working on possibly building their own chips. Now one thing is, I read the article, is even if they do start making their own chips, it will take a little while, whether they're designing it or setting up their own fabs. They've also looked at potentially acquiring companies in order to kind of get a jumpstart on creating their own AI chips. Now this is nothing new. This is what's called vertical integration. Now this is nothing new, this is what's called vertical integration and this is actually one of one of the, it's not an innovation, it's nothing, it's nothing that is like unique or anything, but vertical integration has become much more popular in the tech space, particularly after people seeing the success of Tesla and SpaceX. So what you might not realize is one of the reasons that space flight is so incredibly expensive is because of enormous supply lines and parts being made all over the place. And so one of the things that Elon Musk did in terms of making SpaceX cheaper is vertical integration. So vertical integration means that rather than buying a part from outside of the company, you build it all in-house. And so this makes sense. This actually kind of runs contrary to business theory and business philosophy, particularly in the 70s and 80s as logistics became more sophisticated. It was more about outsourcing. And so instead of outsourcing, now we're insourcing and on-shoring. So this move doesn't surprise me, and I suspect that as these resources become more and more commoditized, we're basically going to eventually see AI chips just like any other processor, which is actually why companies like IBM sold off their entire server and laptop unit because computers are seen as commodities now. So moving forward and directly relevant to this is the global AI arms race. So this news was it's a little bit understated but to me this move by some Southeast Asian countries really, it kind of I'm not saying that this is a warning shot, it's not a shot across the bow this is just, it kinda makes sense. So the TLDR here is that the ASEAN ASEAN nations which is kinda like the EU but for Southeast Asia. Not exactly one for one, but you get the idea. The idea here is that they are taking a more business-friendly, kind of more libertarian approach to AI regulation. So that's the hands-off regulation, which runs very contrary to what the EU is doing. And of course, there's been some pushback against the EU AI Act because it was it was pretty strict in terms of consumer protections. I tend to agree with that. However, in the grand scheme of things, you know, yes, with global economics, you can use sanctions and other diplomatic things in order to try and coerce other nations or other blocks of nations into cooperating. But in the grand scheme of things, this is a global scale game of geopolitical, economic, scientific, and technological chess. And the writings on the wall, as everyone knows today, at least almost everyone knows and agrees, obviously there's some holdouts. But in general, it is understood that the countries and companies that move fastest and furthest on AI will have a distinct advantage, not just economically, but socially and militarily. So there is no incentive for countries to slow down. And this is what I and others have been saying since the infamous pause letter came out. What was it, almost six months ago already? Seems like yesterday. We knew that that was a failed idea. You cannot slow this down. Private enterprise, they're going to do what's in their best interest. Militaries are going to do what's in their best interest. Governments are going to do what's in their best interest. It's basically like strap in, get ready for blast off. We are all along for the ride. This is actually a big component of my research because my assertion, as other people are coming to realize, is you can't stop this. You can't have some high-minded ideal like what some of the CEOs are saying, like, oh, well, we should never make it agentic or, you know, we should do this, that or the other. No, you have to assume that this is an imperfect environment, a highly competitive environment where basically anything goes. And so in that case, basically you're stuck in what I call terminal race condition, which is you're trying to optimize for speed as much as anything else. And as other people call it a race for the bottom, it's not necessarily a race for the bottom because there are also advantages to being smart and ethical. The smarter and more ethical your AI is, the more trustworthy it is and the less oversight it requires. I've talked about this in some of my recent videos where putting effort into lying and being deceptive, that is all wasted effort in my opinion. So pay attention to how things play out between, you know, it seems like the three primary centers of gravity for AI is America, Europe, and Asia, which of course, like, that's most of the world. I'm just excluding, like, the global south from that. But anyways, point being is that this is a really interesting development. It's not surprising, but it is still concerning and it's something to watch. More specifically, as you may or may not remember, earlier this year, the Biden administration placed a pretty heavy trade embargo on AI chips going to China. Again, it's not too surprising, but there's been some pushback from the big Silicon players, Nvidia, Intel, and Qualcomm. They're pushing back on that now, because they're saying, you know, well here, let me just give you the summary first. Cutting sales to China, obviously, if you can't sell to someone, that's bad for business. This is part of the globalist policy that's been in the place since the 1970s and 1980s, which is economic interdependence, reduces your chances of going to war with people because if they have goods that they buy from you and goods that you buy from them, you don't want to shoot yourself in the foot. And so trade embargoes, particularly with gigantic trading partners like between America and China, generally, it's a lose-lose situation, but you do that for geopolitical and military reasons. Now another thing is, and this is actually kind of surprising because some people predicted this, and of course China is incredibly adaptive. So like, I think it it was literally within days of the embargo being announced, China internally announced that they were going to say, OK, well, we'll just develop our own internal expertise, our own internal chip fabs, and we won't need you. So they're like, take a hike. We don't care. So there's many possible unintended consequences and intended consequences from the chip embargo going to China. But you know, basically, if you cut someone off and then they have to develop their own internal expertise, that is a chance for them to then kind of say, well, we don't need you anyways. However, despite, you know, so for instance, what I'm one thing that I'm thinking about is a few years ago, Vladimir Putin in Russia said, you know, the company or the country that, you know, dominates AI will dominate the world, something like that. I know I'm misquoting it. But basically, despite knowing the value of that, and despite having literally hundreds of billions of dollars to invest, Russia was never able to develop the internal expertise to catch up or compete on the global stage with respect to artificial intelligence. Now that being said, China is far more organized and far richer than Russia, so if they set their mind to it, it's entirely possible that, yeah, cutting off trade with China means that they're just going to have their own little isolated island of AI expertise. And in the worst case scenario, it will be like a new Cold War where the Soviets were developing science and technology independent of and parallel to the West. And so there's actually a lot of people that are predicting that we might end up in in like segmented internet world again Which that would be interesting one way or another? I'm not I don't actually know whether or not that's a good thing or a bad thing Until we learn to come together as a global species one of my long-term goals is to Is to help steer humanity towards utopia and part of what I view as utopia obviously there's different Definitions of this, but I think we can all generally agree that like world peace is a good idea And part of part of world peace is open communication So I think that segmented internet and and having you know different different hemispheres of the world, having fundamentally different approaches to artificial intelligence and AI and internet would probably be a bad thing in the long run. Okay, so moving right along, this news comes, I think, yesterday or the day before, and I didn't pay too much attention to it at first, but some of my Patreon supporters were talking about it, and so I gave it a second look. And it's kind of interesting, but unfortunately there's not a whole lot of news yet. But what OpenAI is teasing is that at their upcoming developer conference, they're going to introduce what they're calling a stateful API, which could lower the cost of using the chat GPT API as much as 20 times. Like so 20 fold reduction in cost. So they haven't released the details yet, but in reading about it and talking with people, it looks like it's some form of caching, so that that way it maintains the conversation state. Now I don't know if that just means that it records the text of the conversation, or if maybe they found a more efficient way of reducing cost, which maybe it just records the embedding. Because for those that don't know, the way that chat GPT works internally is it's a transformer architecture. So, on the input side, it creates an embedding, and that embedding is, I think it's a 12,000 dimension vector that just, it's a semantic representation that says, hey, here's where the conversation is at, but you don't need, you know, walls and walls of text, it's all recorded in the embedding. And so if that's what they're doing, which is what I suspect they're doing, in that case, all you have to do is record an embedding and say the conversation state was at this. You don't need all the text. You don't need to re-embed that vector every time. Instead, what you do is you split the model in half, and who knows, maybe it is split in half internally, where they've got the embedding side and then the decoder side or the encoder and decoder side. And so then the Stateful API might just say, okay, here's a UUID connecting to this embedding. So all you have to do is refer to this UUID and you can carry on the conversation from wherever you left off. If I were them, that's how I'd approach this. But as a infrastructure engineer and global solutions architect at other tech companies, that's how I'd approach it in terms of both increasing performance, because if all you have to do is side load a vector rather than embed an entire thing, that'll be faster, but it'll also be much cheaper, because it comes down to watts. Every watt you have to spend redoing and embedding is wasted energy, so reduce, reduce, reduce, just cut down on any excess, like, so one rule of thumb that I have whenever I'm doing automation work is process something once. If you can process something and then record it, if the act of recording is cheaper to energetically speaking and time speaking, then that's gonna be more efficient. And so I've often talked about how, you know, whenever people ask me like, Dave, how do I get around this limitation or how do I reduce costs? My, my response to all of my clients and everyone who asked me is just wait because chat GPT four is like 10 times cheaper than GPT three was a year or two ago. And a year or two from now, it'll be 10 times, or in this case 20 times cheaper. And so you get these compounding returns where, you know, like instead of exponential growth, it's exponential decay. So you know, the cost per token used to be 10 cents, now it's 4 cents, soon it'll be 1 cent, then it'll be, you know, basically trivial cost before too long. Especially as, you know, the chips get better, the models get leaner and more efficient, and other efficiencies are found, not just necessarily in the model, but in the rest of the software architecture and training and all that stuff. So pay attention to this space. This is why I wanted to include this though, is just like, just wait, you know, you'll see 10x drops in cost 20x drops in cost eventually you'll see 100,000 x drops in cost and of course every time that these models get smarter cheaper faster better safer that also makes them a greater threat to jobs which we'll talk about in just a minute okay so this is super exciting I mentioned this on LinkedIn and I made a previous video about it but The ACE framework, the Autonomous Cognitive Entity Framework paper, is live on Archive. It is officially published and released. Obviously, Archive is a pre-print server. This hasn't been to conference yet to be peer-reviewed or anything. But, my open-source team is we just finished the first sprint on building a proof of concept. So actual code applied at this. We had a demo day yesterday, it was an internal demo day. And we learned a lot, we shared a lot of notes, we recorded it. So we're working on a highlight reel from that demo day. But yeah, so this is really exciting. The code is happening. One of the most important things, and I'm not going to like rehash everything, but the most important takeaway from the team conversation yesterday, which was a two-hour conversation, was that there are no technical barriers to progress. Everything that we're trying to do and everything that we need the models to do, they are capable of doing. All of the infrastructure that's underpinning the architecture, all of the vector search databases, all of the message queues, like literally all the pieces are there, we just have to assemble it, and we have to do some of the prompt engineering, figure out the meta-prompting strategies, figure out the communication between the layers. But this stands in stark contrast to my earlier work on cognitive architectures where GPT-3 was good, it just wasn't good enough. Even with fine-tuning, it just wasn't smart enough. The context window wasn't big enough. But particularly GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4, these models are smart enough and they're good enough. And also, I had a few friends join the team who are experts in open-source models. So that was actually one of the biggest, most consistent comments and requests, both in the comments in the previous video and discussions on the GitHub, which is now that people are seeing that cognitive architecture and autonomous agents are eminently possible, there's a tremendous amount of interest in getting this over to open source for numerous reasons, not the least of which is just more control over the models. But we've also seen some recent studies and demonstrations that you can get really good performance out of very small models. I think the most recent one was that a seven billion parameter model outperformed a 70 billion parameter model. So when you have models that are that small, you can run them locally, The most recent one was that a 7 billion parameter model outperformed a 70 billion parameter model. And so when you have models that are that small, you can run them locally. And that is better for privacy, it's better for safety and security, and there's all sorts of reasons that this is better. Now, obviously, these frontier, these flagship models like GPT-4, they're the smartest and most powerful, but the open source space is actually accelerating. So you might remember at the beginning of this year, six to 12 months ago, where people were like, oh yeah, open source is good, but it's a year or two behind. Now open source is only a couple of weeks to a couple of months behind these frontier models, which is really exciting. And it's good news for us, but it also goes back to what I was talking about where the genie is out of the bottle. We cannot contain AI. It is impossible to even try and contain it, so don't bother. Instead, what we need to do is align it and make it autonomous and safe and trustworthy so that it aligns with us and we align with it. That's my opinion, obviously. So that's it for the ACE framework. I do have a couple really small announcements before we get to the rest of the video. First, I've got a new substack. I'm moving away from Medium because a lot of people complained that Medium was paywalled and I was like, no, it's not. But I realized that I actually don't know how Medium works because some things are paywalled and some things aren't and it doesn't ask me. So anyways, I'm moving away from Medium to Substack. Link in the description. I also just activated channel membership, so I'm still working that out, but at the very baseline level, if you become a YouTube channel member, your comments get top priority, you get a set of unique cool emojis. I made those by hand, well, by hand with Dolly, and you also get some unique Raven badges. Also, I've got books, merch, and a little bit more coming soon. So I'm working on a systems thinking book. On my other channel, my Neuro Spicy channel, my systems thinking series is by far the most popular series of videos. So I'm gonna make a whole book teaching you how to think like I do. And then I've also got a sci-fi, right now it's a duology, but it might be a trilogy that I'm working on. I've been referring to this for a while. like Patreon supporters, sub stack subscribers, and channel members, as well as some early access to this stuff. And of course, I've also got the exclusive Discord where we talk about NeuroSpicy stuff and AI and existential coping. The existential coping thread is one of the most popular threads. Anyways, my goal remains the same is I want to maximize the chance of success of humanity, not just surviving, but thriving in the future. So literally everything that I do is based on grassroots support so I really appreciate everyone who Chimes in chips in whatever way that you can like subscribe comment or support me on any of these other platforms All right back to the show So job destruction is something that I talk about a lot I talk about post-labor economics where basically the the central idea of post-labor economics is that getting rid of humans from the workforce is a good thing and that we should actively work to automate away the need for human labor because it is the greatest constraint on progress and productivity. Now that being said, that represents a very fundamental paradigm shift in terms of how we even think about economics. So I'm always keen to pay attention to news and evidence of AI destroying jobs because the thing is, is right now there's no evidence that AI is creating new jobs. Sure, we've had comments from various CEOs saying, oh, we're not going to fire anybody. But then it's like, yeah, but you have a hiring freeze and you just laid off 7,000 people and you created only 1,000 new job openings. So even if you're saying that AI is, quote, creating new jobs, it's creating far fewer than it's destroying. That is, of course, what it seems like is happening now. So in this case, this was another example where it seems like the lowest hanging fruit for AI to replace is obviously graphic artists have been greatly harmed by image generators. The Hollywood writer strike just ended recently. So AI, you know, for writing. So basically creativity was the first thing. The second thing seems to be CSR customer service representative jobs are the next on the chopping block in terms of victims of the AI thing. Now, honestly, like when you think about it, a CSR is kind of like a telephone operator. And of course, telephone operators went out of work decades ago. So, and I'm not obviously like what a CSR does is much more sophisticated than what a telephone operator does, but because it is such a narrowly constrained and defined job, I think that's what makes it very vulnerable to total automation. Because once you have voice, and once you have conversational ability, there's a whole bunch of jobs that are just eminently going to go away. And you look at the progress of like OpenAI Whisper and 11 Labs with voice synthesis, you can even have face-to-face conversations with fully digital avatars, or what I call meta-humans. A meta-human is a facsimile, it is a copy without an original. So meta-humans are probably the creepiest thing. So what I, and we've already seen this actually with influencers and creators and YouTube personalities that like they look like real people But they were never real people and you've probably seen it referred to as like fake humans. I call it meta-humans To be a little bit more specific But the idea is that we are creating AI in our own image Which says a whole bunch of stuff about our deep unconscious psychology and Freudian stuff, which I'm not going to get lost down that rabbit hole. Anyways, long story short, kind of got carried away there, is that job destruction is coming and I still haven't seen any evidence of job creation from AI, at least not any substantive job creation. If you have, please let me know in the comments because I'm happy to follow up on that kind of stuff. So, but yeah. Last or second to last is animal communication. So this has been kind of a recurring theme this year where AI is more and more being used to communicate with dolphins or at least decipher what things like dolphins and whales are saying as well as the chirps of like, was it not was it field rodents or field mice or something like that anyways we are getting better and better at using artificial intelligence in order to understand the communication of animals and the thing is the most important thing here is what the ability to communicate implies about consciousness and sentience. I remember watching a documentary about Coco the gorilla who was able to use sign language in order to express desires and emotions and wants, and there was, maybe there is still controversy, but I remember at the time there was a lot of controversy saying, oh well this isn't communication. She's not actually expressing unique thoughts. She's just matching some behavior to Getting something that she wants instrumentally. She knew how to ask for berries. She knew how to say like, you know want water But I read the book language instinct by Steven Pinker and as a language expert He on he debunkunked that pushback against Cocoa wasn't actually sentient or whatever because she was able to express emotions. When she heard that Robin Williams had died and she had met Robin Williams, she said that she signed cry and something else. I don't remember, but she had an emotive expression. And then there was another, the funniest instance was she got upset and ripped her sink off the wall and then blamed her kitten. So the ability of a gorilla to do something to understand that there would be consequences and then to lie about it. So this is an animal that is not human, but has the ability to deceive So that implies a lot about cognition Which you know, I've recently done videos about AI being able to deceive us whether or not it's deliberate and intentional is another question but anyways I think that what we will come to find as we communicate with animals more and more is That our definition and our understanding of consciousness and sentience is going to expand a lot. Obviously, there's many of you in my audience that already understand this and believe that consciousness and sentience is far more broad spectrum than just humans, but there are also plenty of people who make an argument that consciousness and sentience is exclusively a human thing. Let me know in the comments where you fall on that spectrum. Maybe I'll run a poll later. I'm not really sure. And finally, last but not least, is research on synalytic cells. So, obviously this is a little bit different from artificial intelligence, but longevity is a huge topic here in the fourth industrial revolution. And so if you're not aware what a senolytic cell is, it's basically just an old cell. But what happens is, I watched a full documentary on this, so I can tell you a little bit more about the key thing that's going on here. Senolytic cells are old, and what they do is they start broadcasting inflammation signals. And so these inflammation signals basically say, I'm old and crotchety, like, we're slowly dying. And what we have found is that if you just get rid of senolytic cells, the organism as a whole, I don't know if they live longer, but they're certainly healthier. And so just by getting rid of these little, like, old geriatric cells that are broadcasting inflammation signals, these reactive oxygen species, then the overall organism becomes broadcasting inflammation signals, these reactive oxygen species, then the overall organism becomes healthier and more rejuvenated. So this is one component of aging. It's not a complete solution to aging, but it's like, okay, well, you add senolytic treatments with a few other, like maybe telomere regeneration and a few other, you know, aspects, it's entirely possible that this will become one component of a full package of rejuvenation therapies in the long run. And the reason that I included this is because I have seen so many articles about senolytic cell targeting this year. So this seems like it's kind of the next most eminent frontier. So I wouldn't be surprised if within the next year or two, and maybe it's already here, but people working on getting FDA approval for senolytic drugs that will basically you take a drug and your body's inflammation score goes down and you age much much slower. We'll see if that's how it plays out. So anyways, thanks for watching. Let me know how you like this format. People tend to like how I do deep dives on things and unpack stuff and kind of tell you what it means. Obviously there's plenty of other channels that do news, but I think let me know if you like my particular take on it and yeah I'll adjust accordingly. Thanks for watching, have a good one. accordingly.
