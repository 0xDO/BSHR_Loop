{"text": " Hey everybody, David Shapiro here for another tutorial video. Today we are going to go over fine tuning 101 data prep. So if you've watched my other videos, you know that I'm a big fan of synthetic data sets, especially because one, it's fast, two, it's relatively cheap, and three, you get exactly what you want. So what I want to do is show you an example of how to get synthetic data. Now one thing to keep in mind with fine-tuning is that you're not actually training the model to do anything new. GPT-3 has already trained on many hundreds of gigabytes worth of data. Everything that you ask it to do it already knows how to do, so the purpose of fine-tuning is to narrow down to say do this one thing every time. Now because fine-tuning is to narrow down to say, do this one thing every time. Now because fine-tuning is about removing possibilities, you want to make sure that your fine-tuning data has a broad variety so that it has seen many examples. And we'll get into advanced fine-tuning techniques later. I'll probably do a video going over my question generating bot, because the more variety you show for the input, and the more examples you give in terms of that breadth of variety and different formats, the better it will perform. Now, when you're doing synthetic data in the way that I'm about to show you, it's a very consistent format. But anyways, so I wanted to start with something very simple, which was just imagine a complete and detailed plot synopsis for a blank genre set in a location during a time. And then the story should be, you know, add a couple modifiers, write out the entire plot premise in great detail. Now unfortunately the instruct series models are not the best at going in at long form writing. But you see this one's OK. It's doing all right. So it does a pretty good job. It's almost like a movie poster. It's not actually like writing out the story. But this is good enough for now. With a little bit more prompt engineering, here, actually, let's try it. Instead of premise, let's say outline and see if that modifies it. Yeah, that looks like it's a little bit more detailed, but it's still not actually writing the whole story, because part of the problem is that GPT-3 was not trained on actual like plot outlines. And actually, if you watch my other videos, getting GPT-3 to actually write fiction is really difficult. So I'll modify the prompt to say instead of premise, I'll say plot outline. And we'll just change this here as well. So we're going to say right plot outlines. OK. So we've got this. This is the prompt that I'm going to use and I'm going to auto populate it with different things. So this is a really quick way to get a broader variety of data is where you ask it to do kind of the same prompt but you give it a bunch of different modifiers so effectively what I'm going to do is give it you know 200 different prompts and I'm going to record that output and then use that for fine tuning data and so the scripts that I've got is here here I did something wrong to do to do. The script that I've got is synthesize plots. So what I've got is a list of genres, a list of modifiers, a list of places, and a list of periods. So you get all this, you can get a lot of variety, you can get a lot of combinations. The first time I ran it, I had uncommented all these, and it was going to generate 2,000 different samples. I'm not going to spend that much on a tutorial video. So I cut it down to four by four by four by four. So four to the fourth power is 256. So I've got four examples of each of each thing. And then you might also notice that I've got the up here the UUID. So UUID let me just show you what it looks like. Whoops. Synthesize. Plots. There we go. Okay, so this is showing you the prompts that it's going to run. So it starts with a UUID up at the top. A UUID is just a random string of hexadecimal characters. But one thing that I found is that this does a really good job of causing GPT-3 to have a little bit more internal entropy. By starting it with a EUID, it's like, okay, I'm reading this, I don't know how to make sense of it. So it's trying to create an internal state that doesn't make any sense. So you prime it to be a little bit more different, a little bit more random. This is especially good if you need to run the same prompt over and over and over again. So you do this in combination with a high temperature and you'll get a lot more variety. But anyways, you can see where it's populated out. Imagine a complete and detailed plot outline for a science fiction film set in India during the 1990s. The story should be supernatural and otherWardley. Write out the entire plot outline in great detail. And then you see the number here, 256. So if you go back here, you say I just did a quick count to keep track of how many it generated, just to show you that's what it's doing. So we can comment this out since we don't need this. And then what we'll do is I have some canned functions that I use. So here's the GPT-3 completion. Use text of inch, year two, temperature one, top p of one, tokens a thousand. It's not generating anywhere near that much, and then we'll save all this out to GPT-3 logs, but then what are we going to do with the actual prompt and completion, right? Because for fine tuning you need a prompt and a completion. And we're not going to just record these prompts. What would be the point of that? We're not actually adding anything. So what we got to do is we're going to then format a prompt to look a little bit different. So we'll say completion equals GPT-3 completion. And then I'll feed in my prompt. But I've got the genre, the modifier, the place, and the period. So what I want to do is I'll save the out prompt as it'll be a text. Basically what I'll do is I'll just say. Let's see. Genre equals that and then new line and then I'll say location is dollar s. And so this dollar s I'll show you what I'm gonna do with this in just a second. Genre location period and then and then modifier. And so then we'll do that and then we'll do new line new line and then we'll do lot outline and then we'll add a little space. And so basically what this will look like. Let me show you what the what the actual final prompt will look like. So instead of this, it will have location, period, modifier, and then double newline, plot outline. be like, you know, sci-fi or I guess I had it out as science fiction. Location will be India. Period will be the Renaissance. And then the modifier will be like cerebral and what did I say? Like spooky or whatever. Cerebral and suspenseful. Okay. Okay. So given just these little bit of information um like if I just if I just put this into GPT three right now, it's it'll probably work a little bit. Oh, I misspelled suspenseful. Where did I did I misspell that here? I was just here. OK. I don't think I misspelled it up here. Suspenseful. Yeah correct. OK. It'll probably figure out what I want to do. OK. Yeah. So because it's fine tuned it can figure it out. It's not the best. It certainly is just a plot premise. It's not as complete as what was generated before. But also, this is with text DaVinci 02, which is already fine-tuned to follow instructions. So another thing that you can do is once you generate data, and we'll get into this. Let me do a quick time check actually OK eight minutes we got just a few minutes left you can also go in and augment stuff so one thing that I like to do is go to the edit model which is free right now at least it was and you can say like make this more detailed so let's. So let's, oops, that's not what I meant to do. Oh darn, it got rid of what I wrote. Okay, anyways, point being, I'll show you the edit endpoint, and this will be in an advanced tutorial as well. Anyways, let's go back to our work. Okay, so we've got the completion, so this is going to be the actual plot synopsis, and then the out prompt is this, and I showed you what this is going to look like here. Oh yeah here. Let me just go ahead and show you so we'll give it. We'll get a plot outline. An alternate history in India. Oh now this is fun. Oh, now this is fun. So apparently India invents AI during the Renaissance. That's kind of cool, actually. All right. So here's a food for thought later on. You can use the edit endpoint. And so we'll say, let's see, expand this plot outline to include more detail, make it a complete story. And we'll turn the temperature all the way up because higher temperature generally leads to more creativity. It could also lead to some random stuff that you don't want. But anyways, so another thing that you can do in preparing your data is you can use the edit endpoint to further augment the data. So by baking in multiple steps, you can then have a data set that is trained to do more stuff. Oh, here we go. So this is a much longer plot synopsis. So this is perfect. I'm not going to do this this time, but just I wanted to show you that this is a thing longer plot synopsis. So this is perfect. I'm not going to do this this time, but just I wanted to show you that this is a thing you can do. You can use the edit endpoint to further augment your training data. So this is great. Let's see. Delighted in the stories. Ascetics. Transmutation. I think it actually did like an entirely different story. Okay. I don't know that it actually, yeah. Okay. Like I said, if you have the really high temperature, you can get stuff that you really don't do not expect. All right, moving on. We'll come back to augmenting techniques in a later video. OK. So here we are. This is what we want the the prompt to look like. So this is what we're going to record. And then the output will just be the completion. And so then what we do is we'll do save file. And actually let's do a file name real quick. File name equals time plus dot text. Actually no, file name will be remove the ands from it. So we'll do what's the shortest one? So we'll do place place period genre ok yeah place plus period plus genre plus modifier and then we will, because each one of these is going to be unique, it's only going to touch it once. So then we will because each one of these is going to be unique it's only going to touch it once so then we'll do replace space with nothing and then we'll also do replace the and sign because I don't think I don't think it'll save that as a file and then we'll add dot text and then we'll do save file. So the content of the file will be, wait, make sure I, file path is first, okay. So we're gonna save the prompt out to prompts and then we'll do percent file name and then we'll do out prompt and then we'll do save file. So basically what I'm doing is I'm saving the prompt and completion with the same file name, but two different folders, so then we'll do completions dollar S or a percent S percent file name and then completion and there you have it. That should be it. So what I like to do is for a quick debug because you obviously before you spend a lot of tokens you want to make sure it works right so I print out the prompt here but then let's also just so we can watch while it's going here will do will just copy this so do print. copy this. So we'll do print out prompt and then print completion because why not you know if you're bored and you're watching your data run why not just do it. Okay. So let's do CLS to clear the screen. Oops. You have to wrap the text in actual quotations. Okay. So we'll let it generate one, and then we'll see what happens. So this is a romance and comedy set in France during the Renaissance. This should be fun. Oh, I forgot to do a thing. Yeah, I bet it didn't work right. So this is why you check your work. So during the Renaissance in France, two lovers, Pierre and Marie, must overcome tremendous obstacles to be together. Their families rival noble houses. Oh, this is fun. War is brewing. This sounds like war in the von Dane. Undaunted, Pierre and Marie meet in secret, planning to elope, betrayed by one of Marie's maidservants. Oh, this is fun. Jealous older brother, Henri. In a fierce battle, they are mortally wounded and dies in Marie's arms. He tells her to flee. Marie refuses. So yeah, this is romance and comedy. I don't really see much comedy in here. As the lover's souls depart this world, they vow to find each other again in the next life. So it looks like the modifier is kind of hijacking it. I don't really see how you could make the... I mean, it's certainly romance, but it's not a comedy. So sometimes these things are conflicting, but let's check the output data to make sure that it did what I expected. Okay, so the completion looks right. I like how it's... France, the Renaissance, romance, comedy, cerebral, suspenseful, dot text. You know exactly what you're getting. Okay, so that's good. The completion looks right, but I think the prompt is wrong. Yeah, that's not what I wanted. Okay, so let's fix that. Actually, yeah, let's just go ahead and delete that and delete the completion it'll regenerate it anyways. No don't keep it in. No don't keep it in. OK. So out prompt. Oh that's what I forgot to do. So you do the percent. And then when you have multiple placeholders you need to do need to put it in an iterable like this. So we do genre.place.modifier. So that should be right, and that should be fully populated. Okay, so then let's run this again just to make sure. Let's make this a little bigger. So here's the initial input. And it'll take a second. This is much longer, much better, much better. Okay, so here's the initial input. Here's how we're reformatting that input. So it'll be like this. and then this is the output. When Catherine de Medici is widowed, this is Italy. She's a skilled politician, but not well loved, so this is much longer. This is what we would kind of want to see. So let's go make sure that the data looks right. So the completion, here it is, there we go, go completions and then prompts and there's the prompt and so then what you do after this is you just you remove the escape and you let it go and you synthesize data and we are at 17 minutes. So this is a little bit longer than I try and make my tutorials. So the last thing is just do this and let it run. so I will go ahead and set this to run and then tune in for the next video where we'll go over data prep. And I think probably what I'll do is talk about data augmentation and cleanup at that time because that's all part of data prep. So anyways, thanks for watching. Tune in again, and I'll see you all again soon. you", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 5.28], "text": " Hey everybody, David Shapiro here for another tutorial video."}, {"timestamp": [5.28, 11.04], "text": " Today we are going to go over fine tuning 101 data prep."}, {"timestamp": [11.04, 15.48], "text": " So if you've watched my other videos, you know that I'm a big fan of synthetic data"}, {"timestamp": [15.48, 20.0], "text": " sets, especially because one, it's fast, two, it's relatively cheap, and three, you get"}, {"timestamp": [20.0, 22.04], "text": " exactly what you want."}, {"timestamp": [22.04, 25.92], "text": " So what I want to do is show you an example of how to get"}, {"timestamp": [25.92, 30.2], "text": " synthetic data.
