{"text": " Warning. For viewers sensitive to issues of race, be advised that the following piece contains gratuitous use of the n-word. And by n-word, I mean nigger. There, I said it. For the last 15 years, a man named Clayton Bixby has been the leading voice of the white supremacist movement in America. Despite his popularity, very few have ever seen him due to his reclusiveness, but in an effort to bring his message to a wider audience, he agreed to give his first public interview ever. Excuse me. Not sure we're in the right place. We're looking for Clayton Bigsby. Well, look no further, fella. You found me. Uh, Clayton Bigsby, the author? What, you don't think I can write them books? Just because I'm blind don't mean I'm dumb. How could this have happened? A black white supremacist. Our search for answers led us here to the Wexler home for the blind, where Mr. Bixby spent the first 19 years of his life. Bridget Wexler is the home's headmistress. Well, he was the only negro we'd ever had around here, so we figured we'd make it easier on Clayton by just telling him and all the other blind kids that he was white. And he never questioned it. Why would he? You've never left this property, have you, Mr. Bixby? No, sir, not in many years. What if I were to tell you that you are an African-American? Sir! Listen, I'm gonna make this clear. I'm in no way, shape, or form involved in any narrative. You understand? Now if you'll excuse me, I have a book signing to go to. Black Power! Black Power! Open up your heart and let that hate out! Yeah! Show us your face. We want to see your face. Yeah! Who said that? You want to see my face? Yeah! We're talking about this. Don't hate me! I'm trying! Yeah! Black! Relax! There is cookie and punch for us to enjoy and we can meet, talk about white brotherhood. Thank y'all for coming. White power! We're told that in the last few weeks he has accepted the fact that he is a black man. And three days ago, he filed for divorce from his wife. When we asked, why, after 19 years of marriage, he responded, because she's a nigger lover. years of marriage he responded because she's a nigger lover", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 9.5], "text": " Warning.
