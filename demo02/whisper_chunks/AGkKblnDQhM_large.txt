{"text": " I give all married men the same advice, gay or straight, get a dog. This dog will love you all the time, but she's not going to. It's real talk. I didn't even know about dogs and my kids got the dog. They brought them home from the shelter and I didn't even want it. They're like, can we keep them? I said, nope. I said, where'd you even get this dog? They're like, we got him from the shelter. I was like, ew. Probably something wrong with him. Can't keep him. And then my kids started crying and screaming like the dog had gambling debts. Please, Dad, if you don't let us keep him, they're gonna kill him! I was like, oh. All right, you can keep him. And this dog was a menace. I hated his guts. Then one night, I had smoked a bunch of weed, and I was eating a sandwich, and Baa-Baa came over. Baa-Baa's a dog. He came over and was staring at me. This will make you very uncomfortable if you're just looking at your usual. \u266a I had to give him a piece of my sandwich so he'd go away. And that's how we became friends. Now, if you see me walking down the street with Baa Baa, I ain't got no leash or nothing, he walks right next to me. If I stop, he'll stop. And if I go, he'll go. And all my friends are like, yo, Dave, that shit is dope. How you train Baa Baa to do that shit, hmm? I've never trained Baa Baa. Just a message. I'm just a message. I'm just a message. He'll go. And all my friends are like, yo, Dave, that shit is dope. How you train Baba to do that shit? Hmm? I've never trained Baba. Just a messy eater. If I drop food and Baba's not around, all I got to do is call him. Baba! He's a black dude's dog, so he doesn't come right away. He peeks first to see what's going on. Yeah. I got to tap my foot so he can see the food. Over here, little buddy. And he's like, thanks, David. I'll come get it and run off. But he knows all my habits. Like, if he smells weed in the house, he'll be like, this motherfucker's about to eat, and he'll just come running. And he'll just come running. And he'll just come running. And he'll just come running. And he'll just come running. And he'll just come running. And he'll just come running. And he'll just come running. And he'll just come running.

I don't know if anyone's married here, but after 10 years, all that chatty shit goes away. You've said it all. You know what I mean? Yeah, we're just in the zone. She says the same shit to me every night before she goes to bed. I'll be the last one up. She's like, I'm gonna get some sleep, Dave. Good night. All right, baby. We'll stay up and watch television. Good night. And she'll walk halfway up the steps. David. Huh? Don't eat the kids' lunch. And then she walks away. Well, the crazy shit is, I don't even eat their lunch anymore. Back in the day, I used to eat that shit. You know how that goes. I might smoke some weed in the middle of the night and she'll leave neatly wrapped sandwiches all over the kitchen. I'm gonna eat it. What's the big deal? Why can't she just make another one in the morning? I mean, it's like, I got sons anyway. And sons love everything their dads do. My kids are best cool the next day, just look like, oh, bit my sandwich, oh shoot! Their dad is Dave Chappelle, man. He could trade that sandwich for something better.
