{"text": " You know how whenever you go to the doctor and they ask you a million and a half questions and then the doctor asks you the same questions over again? Well, I wanted to automate that. But also, I was inspired by this article that came out just last week or in the last couple of weeks. Basically, the story is, Chad GPT correctly diagnosed a four-year-old's pain after 17 doctors failed. It took three years and it was it was basically something wrong with his spinal cord and that the you know, the parent having access to chat GPT was able to talk through it and figure out what exactly to share with with the doctors and what to ask for and was able to get a proper diagnosis and now because of AI they were able to diagnose this tethered cord syndrome and treat the little boy, which is great. But rather than allowing or basically requiring someone to fudge through it on their own, I wanted to apply my considerable technical skills at automating this pipeline. So let me show you real quick. Oops, you don't need to see that. There we go. Let me show you real quick. Whoops, you don't need to see that. There we go. Let me show you real quick what I did. So this is what it looks like. We'll unpack all the code in just a moment, but I wanted to show you end-to-end what I did. So first, let me zoom in so that you can see this. First, it's a simple chatbot that acts like that intake interview. And before we jump in, I need to say that very definitively, this is not a medical device. This is not approved by the FDA. This is not approved by any medical regulator. It is also provided under the MIT license, which means use this at your own risk. It is provided as is. This is provided for scientific curiosity only. Do not use this at your own risk. It is provided as is. This is provided for scientific curiosity only. Do not use this as a medical device. Do not use this for diagnosis. It is not ready. I will unpack all the reasons why it is not ready by the end of the video. But it is useful and it is helpful, and I want to basically just prove that the technology is ready for the next step in clinical usage with the proper testing, so on and so forth. Okay, so with that out of the way, it starts off as a simple chatbot that it has this very simple mission of asking clinical questions, the same way that an intake nurse will ask you kind of these interview questions to figure out what's going on. The next thing that it does is it compresses everything that you give it into just a few notes. And so again, this is the point, so it takes that whole conversation, compresses it to the most salient notes, and then from those notes, it will generate a couple of hypotheses. And so this clinical report is what it believes are the most likely possible things to investigate. So these are diagnostic hypotheses, which again, this is not necessarily how all clinicians work, and also some clinicians out there might be saying, well, you're kind of jumping ahead because you shouldn't be coming up with a hypothesis yet. There's also a few problems with this, so let's start unpacking why this really simple approach is... I'm already aware that it's flawed. So this is basically just kind of bringing up the things that it thinks are most likely. We don't know how CHAT-GPT was trained to handle things like symptoms. It's entirely possible that it will miss rarer conditions. And I've actually thought about creating a version of this that is for like, you know, hey, we've already gone through like a lot of specialists, we're trying to find rare conditions now. If CHAT-GPT was able to help find the cause of that little boy's pain with tethered cord syndrome, I think it probably has the capacity to systematically and formally discover rare conditions, but this is more of a primary care practice, a PCP kind of approach. Because again, one of the things that, particularly in America, that's a problem is medical care is incredibly expensive, and if you can reduce most doctor's office visits to like five minutes with a nurse And then they interact with a machine Then the cost could go from hundreds of dollars to literally like five to ten dollars per visit And this could be something that could really drastically help underserved populations Okay. So in this case, I was pretending to be an older gentleman who is having freezing episodes. If you're familiar with the news, there is a particular older gentleman who has had some rather public freezing episodes, and so I basically pretended to be him. Or someone who's presenting similar things of freezing for 20 seconds every now and then. So the chat intake takes all that and then compresses it down to notes. Then it generates this clinical report, this set of diagnostic hypotheses. It says, okay, this is what I think it is. In this case, it could be a transient ischemic attack, also known as a mini stroke, blah, blah, blah. So it just spells it out in plain English, neurological dysfunction caused by temporary loss of blood flow. Differentials, so for those of you that are not familiar with the clinical term, differentials is basically like, what are some similar but different things that could cause the same thing? And in working with CHAT GPT and the API to figure out exactly how to approach this, I realized that one thing that clinicians always do is they're keeping in mind, okay, here's my primary hypothesis, but here's also a list of differentials that I need to keep track of. And just by writing it down, these are all other avenues to investigate. Demographics, more common in older adults, particularly those over 60 and that's probative here because the patient is 80 or in his 80s. Symptoms, sudden weakness or numbness on one side of the body, confusion, blah blah blah, so on and so forth. Indicators, patient AIDS, episode of free, sorry, patients age, episodes of freezing, loss of consciousness, confusion or difficulty in finding the right words after episodes. Contraindicators, loss of consciousness, confusion or difficulty in finding the right words after episodes. Contraindicators, no reported weakness, numbness, severe headache or dizziness. So, from a clinical perspective, something like indicators is this is stuff that says, yes, this is positive, this is positively correlated with what we're thinking about. And then contraindications or contraindicators are things that basically say, well, it's not hitting on all cylinders, it doesn't match up perfectly. So again, like differentials, you want to be mindful of what matches and what doesn't match. Prognosis TIAs are often warning signs of future strokes with proper management, the risk can be significantly reduced. So this is all information that can be like either given to the patient or given to, you know, an intake nurse or someone who might have less specific experience. But again, it's also important to remember that these are not diagnosis yet. These are hypotheses for investigation. And then finally, it recommends some potential treatments and tests to go with it. And then the second option is epilepsy. So I actually watched a neurophysician, whatever, neurologist, that's the word, a neurologist breakdown, actually several breakdowns of some of these events, and they basically said the same thing. The two primary things that they suspect are transient ischemic attacks, which is a mini-stroke, or epilepsy, or a particular kind of epilepsy. So in this case, based on outside information, this chat GPT API directly agrees with what some professionals have mentioned. Granted, again, any responsible clinician will tell you you cannot diagnose someone just from watching a couple videos of them freezing up in public. But given the same information that I have and giving that information to this tool that I've built, it came up with roughly the same basically clinical, I'm not gonna say conclusion, but avenues of investigation. And so then the next phase is, now that it has done the intake, it has summarized the intake, it has come up with a few hypotheses, it is now recommending clinical evaluation, and I actually messed up on the output, so we need to switch over to the logs. And I have it save it all to log files right now. Now, if you want to use this or test it out, obviously don't put your own personal clinical information up on GitHub. Don't put it up publicly. Don't share it with anyone other than your medical provider because of patient confidentiality laws, which are pretty universal. They're actually stricter in Europe, I believe, than in America. So anyways, here's a breakdown of what we save. So here's the chat log, here's the notes, here is the diagnostic hypotheses, and then finally here's the clinical pain. So this is a clinical report or a clinical evaluation report that is meant to be then given to the physician or the clinician, whether it's a nurse practitioner or registered nurse or physician's assistant. And so the first thing that it does is recommend all of the sensations to engage with the patient in order to basically dial in, like, what is it that you're looking for and the reason that I included this is because if you talk to particularly ER physicians, but really any experienced physician They can often get a tremendous amount of information just by walking into a room and glancing at the patient There will be specific like pallors that the patient might have or like expressions There could also be particular smells associated with very various conditions. So for instance, if someone is in ketosis, they're going to have a very distinctive smell which chat GPT doesn't have a sense of smell yet. So, but, but it can tell the clinician like, Hey, if you smell this thing, this is a sign of ketosis and pay attention to that because that can be very probative. Whereas inexperienced clinicians might not recognize, they might notice the smell but they might not know what it means. And so this section is basically saying like, hey, look for this kind of thing. The second section of the clinical report is examination. So this is like what you're physically supposed to do. You know how like the doctors always come in and they poke and they prod you and they like check your reflexes, that sort of thing. This first version, it recommended other examinations that are not part of the primary care practice. So I modified it. So if you run this again, it'll give you slightly different output. And then finally, it also has some recommended interview questions. So this is basically priming the doctor or the clinician to say hey Here are some follow-up questions that you might want to use in order to Interview this patient to get better more information. And again, this is why? Physicians always ask some of the same questions again. It's not that they don't necessarily trust their their their intake staff It's just they want to see your reaction for themselves And they also might you know based on their clinical experience dial in to something that the intake clinicians missed So yeah in this case I have it set so that it'll tell you like what it's looking for So episode triggers in the case of the freezing, have you noticed any patterns or triggers? Post-episode symptoms, medical history, and concussion follow-up, like have you done anything for the concussion that preceded all this? So this is the clinical evaluation, and then finally, you know how doctors, they'll send you away with a list of tests and referrals and stuff. So I have it do the same thing. So the referral here from primary care says, go to a neurologist. I'm actually kind of surprised that it didn't recommend a cardiologist. However, it did recommend a carotid ultrasound. So basically saying like, hey, let's check for any blockages of the blood flow to the brain. So let's do an EEG. This will test to identify abnormal electrical activity, which again, one of the neurologists that I watched recommended this, but she did point out that one of the problems with some of these transient things is that the abnormal electrical activity is itself also transient, if it is the case of a seizure or epilepsy. And so it can be difficult to determine unless you like have the electrodes on someone while they're having an episode. An MRI, again this makes sense because if there's a lesion or a tumor or something the MRI will discover that. And then CBC for and metabolic panel. So this basically says like, hey, there could be some underlying medical conditions such as anemia or electrolyte imbalances, which would be interesting. So again, like, you just need more information. But yeah, so this is an end-to-end process that the only input I gave it was this chat log. And then you can see it compressed it into clinical notes, which can be recorded in a chart. It came up with some diagnostic hypotheses. It came up with a clinical recommendation panel, basically senses, examination, and interview questions. And then finally, referrals, labs, and tests. So this is an end-to-end process, and I've kind of unpacked some of the limitations along the way. So one of the chief limitations is obviously, CHAT GPT does not have hands, it doesn't have eyes, ears, nose, whatever. So it doesn't have all the clinical senses that a clinical practitioner will have, but it has read enough of this content on the internet in order to understand that this is generally how medical evaluations go. And my goal here is twofold. One, I want to demonstrate that it's possible and relatively simple. So a little bit of background about me is, back in my corporate days, I was an IT infrastructure engineer with a specialization on cloud and automation. And so the biggest project that I ever automated was to update the firmware of several hundred servers as well as the drivers of the operating systems running on those servers. And these were hypervisors. So, a hypervisor is a particular kind of server that runs virtual machines. So, this is the kind of hardware and software stack that underpins all cloud instances. What I had to do was we had a critical patch on our storage system, so we had several petabytes of data that we needed to make sure we didn't disrupt, and we had hundreds of really, really large servers. By large servers, I mean these servers had two terabytes of RAM each running cloud-based workloads. What I needed to do was I needed to update the firmware after we updated the firmware of the storage system. So I needed to update the firmware of the storage cards on the servers and then update the drivers within the operating systems running on those servers. And I needed to do it without disrupting the workload. So rather than spend weeks and weeks doing this manually, I automated, I spent one week writing the scripts to do this automatically, and then I set it to go overnight. It worked for about eight hours straight while I was asleep and I came back the next morning. All of my servers had been patched and rebooted. And yeah, so I did this back in like 2015. So this is like old hat for me. And so the automation process of five simple steps like this is like pretty basic. Now, obviously, if you've been following my work, you know that I'm working on something that is fully autonomous and should be able to do this entirely on its own with the simple mission of achieve the best health outcome for the patient as the mission. But what I wanted to show is that for a more structured approach for something that could be adapted to be a clinical tool today, this is something that is within the realm of possibilities. Another major gap from this tool is, again, we don't really know how CHAT-GPT will identify things. So there's a rule of thumb in the medical community which common problems are common. And so you know transient ischemic attack and epilepsy, these are common conditions that pretty much everyone knows about. It does mention a few other possibilities like syncope, migraine, metabolic disorders, panic attacks, you know that sort of thing. So it does pick up on a few other things. But what one thing that is lacking from this system is it doesn't, I haven't basically focused on differentials or rare conditions, but that would be pretty easy as an additional step. Um, so basically you, you, I w what I would do for that is I would just plug in the notes and say, Hey, um, like based on these, like here's the common things we know about, what are the rare things? What are the differentials that we might be ignoring? And so that would be a relatively easy thing to add, but you don't necessarily want to count on that only, which is why I ended it with referrals and follow-up tests, because that's the responsible thing to do anyways. You know, patients are gonna be intrinsically unaware of some of the things going on inside their bodies. So anyways, now that you understand kind of what's going on here, let's explore the repository. So I have a gigantic medical device disclaimer here on the front. Just because, again, I need to drive home the point that this is provided under the MIT license, which is a highly permissive open source license. This is for experimental purposes only, demonstration purposes only, so on and so forth. Okay, so how do you use this, though? How do you run it? Basically, you just run chat.py and it'll do the rest from there. Once you're done, you just type in DONE in all caps and it'll move on to the rest of the procedure, of the workflow. So the chat.py is a very, very simple basic chatbot, and then it goes through a few steps. It's really repetitive, it just loads different system messages and pipes the right information. And all of the information that gets piped into those system messages are logged in the logs. The log files are saved in sequential order, so there's the chat, there's the notes, there's the diagnostic hypotheses, there's the clinical examination, and then finally there's the referrals. This end-to-end, the longest thing is actually the chat. Then it takes about 60-120 seconds for the rest of it to generate and say, like, hey, here's the clinical thing and here's some referrals that we might do. The idea here is, if I were to design a product for this today and where would I deploy it, I would aim this at disempowered or underserved communities. Maybe not even necessarily in America or Europe, but there are plenty of underserved communities all around the world that don't have access to high quality healthcare, or they might have a shortage of clinicians. And so this could definitely offload a lot of the work, and then you have the experienced clinicians that basically take a look at it, sign off and say, yes, this seems seems reasonable or go this way instead or whatever. Okay, so then I've got all of the all of the system messages saved as markdown files. So you can take a look at these and you can see like it's actually relatively straightforward. This is the system message that I use for the chat bot. So mission, you're a patient intake chatbot focusing on symptoms. Your mission is to ask questions to help a patient fully articulate their symptoms in a clear manner. Your chat transcript will ultimately be translated into chart notes. So I'm just giving it just enough context so it knows what its purpose is and where in the process it is operating. I had to add a second thing for rules, because if you don't ask one question at a time, it'll list like 10 questions and I'm like, chat GPT seriously. Clinicians are not going to rattle off like 10 questions in a row. I said, ask only one question at a time, provide some context or clarification around the follow-up questions you ask. Then I said, do not converse with the patient. And the reason I had to add this one is because it would say, I'm sorry, you're feeling that way. Let's invest, I'm like, no, just ask the fricking questions. So, this resulted in the style and tone that you see here where it says, I understand your concern. Can you please describe it? So it's just, it's really down to basics. Thank you for sharing. Can you tell me more about the fall, you know, just no nonsense Just very direct very straightforward The second part is the prepare notes So mission you're a charting bot that will be given a patient intake transcription You are to translate the chat log into thorough medical notes for the physician so again, I'm telling it where in the process it is and into thorough medical notes for the physician. So again, I'm telling it where in the process it is and what the context is, and it knows enough. I don't have to tell it exactly what to do. I just say this is where in the process and it kind of understands. I did give it an interaction schema here which says the user will give you the transcription. Your output will be a hyphenated list of notes. Make sure you capture the symptoms and any salient information in an orderly and structured manner. So again, I added this just so that it would be consistent. I say generate notes. Make sure you capture the symptoms and any salient information in an orderly and structured manner. So again I added this just so that it would be consistent. I say generate notes and so in this case the notes you see it follows this format where it's just a list of hyphenated notes. No nonsense, no fluff, nothing extra. It captures everything in as few words as possible. Then for the diagnostic part, this one is a little bit different. So mission your medical notes bot that will be given a chart or symptoms of a patient shortly after intake. Again, give it some context. You will generate a list of most likely diagnostic or avenues of investigation for the physician to follow up on. So again, I'm telling it, like, come up with some medical hypotheses. I could have used the term hypotheses, but when you use the word hypothesis, my fear there is that ChatGPT will think that like it's more of a scientific hypothesis, but I said most likely diagnosis or avenues of investigation. So interaction scheme of the user will give you medical notes, you'll generate a report with the following format. So here's the report format, description of the condition, alternatives, so on and so forth. Yep, so you have that. It's very straightforward. Also, this isn't rendering correctly. This is weird. So, let's zoom in. I'm not sure why it's not rendering correctly in Markdown, but you see like potential diagnosis in all caps, description of the condition. We see that format reflected here when we come here, where you see transient ischemic attack, differentials, demographics, symptoms, indicators, so on and so forth. Yeah, I don't know what was going on with GitHub. It freezes up sometimes. Hey, GitHub had a senior moment. We need to diagnose GitHub. Okay, so that was the diagnostic part. Coming back out here, the clinical part, the way that this works, mission, you are a medical intake bot, you are preparing for this final step before a medical professional, physician, nurse, or a physician's assistant evaluates the patient in a clinical setting. You'll be given notes from the patient's intake as well as system-generated diagnostic avenues. You are to prepare some clinical recommendations to evaluate the patient. Keep in mind that this is a primary care visit. So I had to add the primary care visit because it was like trying to jump ahead to like MRIs and stuff and I'm like no, this this is just like basic stuff. You're not going to be like immediately trundled off to an MRI, at least not in America, on a primary care visit. In countries with more sophisticated medical systems I've actually heard stories where someone went to their primary care for like a lump in their breast and immediately was taken across the hall to a mammogram. So it's like, okay, in an ideal situation, yes, you would just immediately go right over to whatever medical device you need to. But we're going to follow the American paradigm, which is deliberately inefficient. Go figure. Thanks, insurance companies. We hate you. Okay, so senses. So basically I say like, you know, you're going to pay attention to all of your senses as part of the clinical test. Obviously this is not for chat GPT. This is to recommend to the clinician. The clinical examination and interview questions, I already kind of showed you all this in great detail. But here is what it looks like in the system message. I say like, here's the examination technique, here's the description of what to look for and why it's probative, probative purpose of the question in all caps, and then suggested question, and there you have it. And then finally, the referrals. So the referrals part, again, very straightforward. You're a clinical medical bot, you'll be given medical notes, charts, your primary job is to recommend specialist referrals and or follow-up tests. So here's the referrals part, where it just says type of specialist in all caps, description of the workup, recommendations, so on, e.g. what are they looking for and why, and then finally the types of labs and tests. So type of lab work, type of tests, so on and so forth, and just kind of describe, like, this is what you're going to send out. And this would be, this information would be handed to the clinical staff in order to follow up for the patient. But rather than have the physician do all of this, it's completely automated, so the physician, all they have to do is sign off on it. And if they agree or disagree, they can add some notes as to why, but basically, like, this could be integrated into Epic or Cerner or any other of, you know, medical software provided companies right now, today, because this is basically how those medical softwares already work. This is just adding LLMs as a layer to increase the power of those things. So, yeah, I think that's about it. You've seen the whole thing. The whole repo is relatively straightforward. I've got the readme, I've got the license, I've got the demo log so you can take a look for yourself. But yeah, it's just a very linear workflow of information with the goal of streamlining medical care. Again, like, take all of this with a grain of salt. There are some enormous limitations. I would love to partner with someone, whether a university or medical research or even government research in order to explore making this more robust and exploring its efficacy and if it actually helps clinical settings. Because here's the thing, you can have something that works in theory, but if the tool is not helpful, then the clinicians won't use it. Or if it's actually harder to use and more distracting and actually decreases medical outcomes, that would be bad. But I would love to see something like this being implemented sooner rather than later, and I think that we could both increase the quality of patient outcomes and decrease the cost of clinical practices. So, I think that's about it. Thanks for watching. Cheers.
