{"text": " You know, gang, all week long, people have been asking me if I was gonna do any characters from the Chappelle show tonight. And at first, I wasn't going to. And then I saw that episode of Walking Dead where they smashed this guy Glenn on the head and killed him. I know. It was devastating. Because I love that show, and Glenn was, like, one of my favorite characters. So I was, like, crushed. So, in that spirit and with that in mind, I hope you enjoy this. -\u266a\u266a -\u266a Whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, whistle, I just cannot decide which one of you is going to dance with death tonight. Wait. I got an idea. Bubble gum, bubble gum... in a dish. How many pieces do you wish? \u266a\u266a Bubble gum. I like two things. My mouth feels dry. Oh, he's a feisty one. I like that. Well, with all due respect, Mr. Negan, um, in my line of work, when you're on your knees, they don't give you bubblegum. They give you penis. Shut up! Well, well, well. A nigga named Negan. I think you look more like a Stephanie. Your face looks like Fonzie made the Negro Leagues. Stop it, Zookie. You're killing him. Them some ugly-ass boots you got on there. As the white boys say on the Internet, what are those? Somebody, you drippy! Dry and brittle jerry curl. Disgrace. Ha ha ha. Look at this pasty bastard. Oh, God, no. Ha ha ha. Good God, have some goddamn respect for yourself. Man the f*** up! What do you want, money? Sex? It's sex, money? Sex? Sex, isn't it? I'll try some sex. I have a wife! What?! I have a wife! What?! I have a wife. Okay! Come on, man. All lives matter. All of us, right? Not if black lives don't. Kill us for what?! Well, well, well. I know that smell, anyway. Frustration and cocoa butter. Looks like we got us a necro-monk. I just put that back. Damn, monkey! Monkey, don't you realize you're black? Ah, from what I hear, this hat would say otherwise. Trump's America now, boy. It sure is. Well, I stand corrected. Seems like a lot of you still got some fight in you. It's good. I like that. Makes it more fun. You can breathe. You can blink. You can cry. Oh. Oh. Yeah. A lot of you are gonna be doing some of that. Thanks. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Hey, nigga, which one of us y'all gonna hit? The suspense is killing me. You look like a champ! Come here, you. Strike one. Yeah!

And that is how we as a nation began to heal, through laughing together. For even though our country seems irrevocably severed like a man from his head, let my example prove that we should continue to move forward. Let us see ourselves in one another, for only empathy can conquer hate. I am every man. I am every woman. It's all in me. Anything you want done, baby, I do it naturally. Now, let's break out, y'all. I only got two months until they take away my healthcare.
