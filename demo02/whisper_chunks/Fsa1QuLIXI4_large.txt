{"text": " We are four days away from the federal election and one thing is clear tonight the PM has a problem with women voters. The worst Australian newspaper had a chat to 50 young females most of them were scathing of Scott Morrison quote he's an open sexist another he doesn't represent me. Let's bring in our panelists author and journalist Carolyn Ovington, Kiss FM newsreader Brooklyn Ross good to have you both here. Carolyn how much do you think the PM has a problem with women do you think and what's a problem with women, do you think? What's it going to do to the outcome of this election? Well women are a really important voting bloc, we know that. We're well past the days where you could rely on the little woman in the House to vote the way her husband told her. Women today are very independent and very strong minded. A lot of the women in this particular poll were very young. And I think that they've been energised by characters like Grace Tame, who has stood really firmly against violence against women, and perhaps also Brittany Higgins, who was the face really of the Women's March. But I wonder if they were also influenced by people like Jackie Lambie. People really like Jackie Lambie, and they really trust her. And there's that fantastic clip that goes around in which she says, I've sat opposite a lot of people in my job and I've never met a bully like Scott Morrison. She actually uses that word, bully. So it's not just women on one side of the political spectrum, it's women on all sides of the political spectrum. Interestingly, we haven't seen a lot of Jenny Morrison so far. We saw a little bit today of Jenny Morrison, but we haven't seen a lot of her in the campaign. She in the past has been used, and I don't mean that in a derogatory way, but to try to soften the PM's image because people really like her and Australian women really like her. They see her as a devoted mum and a devoted housewife and very committed to her kids and so on. We haven't seen as much as her, which might explain this result. Well, interestingly, tonight she's on his Instagram feed, helping talk about the superannuation plan for first home buyers. So Jenny is starting to be wheeled out now. Is that a direct response to, there's that clip there, is that a direct response to Brooklyn do you think of the Prime Minister addressing the fact that he knows he's got a problem with women voters? Yeah I'd say absolutely and like you said Caroline we've seen Grace Tame, Brittany Higgins, he just wasn't able to get along with those two figures who were really held up as two brave women who stood up to misogyny and Scott Morrison just kind of became their enemy. Well does he have a problem then with women or young women voters I wonder? I think probably more young women, I don't know, I couldn't answer that. But we also had Gladys Berejiklian, she's a woman, a female leader who was really highly respected. She ended up reportedly saying that, you know, he was a horrible person as well. It's women across the political spectrum and of different ages. The question for the election is how much each group will vote as a bloc. I mean, women will not vote as a bloc, the same as men will not vote as a bloc. Brooklyn, what did you think about that I mean a major talking point the past few days has been the coalition's plan to allow young people to tap into their super to buy a home to try and get over the housing crisis. Good idea? Bad idea? I think it's a terrible idea. I never showed any interest in my super till I was at least 30 years old and I think that's probably the same for most people like you just don't care about it. So the thought of using it to buy a house seems great. This money means nothing to me, I'll take it now. But when you do get a bit older you realise the great benefits there are to super, particularly putting money into it as early as possible and leaving it there. That's how super works. Compound interest. It builds up and it's there when we need it at the end. Shifting it around earlier on in life, it's not a benefit to anyone. Carolyn, a few economists have raised an eyebrow about this whole plan, worried about it, could push prices up even further and deplete retirement savings. What do you think? It's unquestionably a bad idea. Whether or not it helps young people get into the housing market is a different question altogether. If that's what you want, if you want young people to get into the housing market, then you have to bring in some kind of enforced savings plan, like I'm going to take 10 per cent of your young income and you're going to use that for a house deposit and nothing else and I won't tax you on it, but let's not call it super. People say, oh well, housing is a better investment. Also actually stocks and shares are a better investment than housing. But you can't live in stocks and shares. And the big problem for young people is they have nowhere to live. They're at the mercy of the rental market, which is very insecure, also extremely expensive, very difficult to get a house deposit together when you're paying $300, $400, $500 a week in rent. How do you even imagine doing it? I think this plan is waving the white flag saying we've run out of ideas, we have no idea how to get young people into homes anymore, they're just too expensive, too out of reach, what can we do? The break glass comes for the super, there you go, use that to get into a house. How much super do young people really have? Not much. Some young people have $2,000 or $4,000, this is not a house deposit. And usually they're in five different locations. Right, and we should take this moment to remind them to consolidate your super and you will pay less fee. We're talking a fair bit about what Scott Morrison's been doing, right or wrong, but we haven't really addressed Anthony Albanese, which we should do out of fairness. Should he have changed gears this week? I mean, he walked away from a press conference today, he got shouted at by the press pack again as he tried to scamper out the back door there, which wasn't a good look. Is he playing it right this week or not? I don't know. I think all the way along, Labor has probably been playing the playbook of let Scott Morrison lose. You know? The less Anthony does, like just don't get into trouble, Anthony. Don't go out there and say the wrong thing. Don't forget what the cash rate is. Just lay low and let it play out. That's probably what they're doing. What do you think, Ellen? Walking out on a press conference is never a good idea. It never looks brave and it never looks strong. I think that the Australian public is looking for a leadership, a proper leadership contest. I'm not sure that they've got one. It's very true that there are a lot of people who don't like Scott Morrison. We have seen that. He's still ahead, I think, in the preferred Prime Minister stakes. And the reason he is is because Albo, as we like to call him, hasn't really stepped up. Often when you get a Labor leader elected, it's a hawk or it's a Keating or it's a Whitlam. It's a big moment and a big idea and a fantastic movement of people behind him. Remember Kevin O'Shea came charging up with all those youngsters behind him, really presenting a strong, comfortable, confident face. People could say, you know what, I'm going to change. I'm going to go with that guy. With Elbow really isn't generating that sense of momentum and that might be a problem on the line. That's exactly what I feel about this election too. Most polls are saying, not all, but most are saying, you know, it's going to be a problem on the market. That's exactly what I feel about this election too. Most polls are saying, not all but most are saying, you know, it's going to be a clear Labor win, but you just don't feel it, do you? You don't feel it. In the same way what you described. Let's change the topic altogether and get away from the election. This is an interesting story. A rising young soccer player in the UK has come out as gay. He's the first active professional openly gay male footballer in England since 1990, which seems ridiculous. Have a listen to this Feel like I'm ready to tell people about my story. I want people to know the real me and Lying all the time. This isn't what I've wanted to do and it has been a struggle You know that 17 year old Jake Daniels who plays for Blackpool Football Club, Brooklyn Jake said he was in fact inspired by Adelaide United's Josh Cavallo, who came out last year. I still find this extremely surprising at the elite level, that there's still a cultural problem where gay players, gay sports people can't come out and be open. Yeah, it's pretty sad. I mean, great, good on this guy, like that's fantastic, it's so good to see. I'm gay but I don't play soccer so I called my friend who does play soccer but he's straight and I said you know what's going on what do you think the issue is here why is it taken so long and he actually went through a few good points I mean sledging is a big one when you're out on the the field. So from the fans? From fans and I guess from teams to teams. And he said that, you know, even though away from sport, a lot of players wouldn't, you know, sledge in particular ways. It comes out on the field. And the other is particularly in English soccer and European soccer, a lot of the money is coming from countries where homosexuality is still not allowed, it's still illegal. So like China and in the Middle East. And so it's almost like when actors would not come out so that they would keep the big roles available for them as the ladies' man, they're kind of doing the same thing if they want to get money from there. So I mean, he went through a range of things and it's sad. I hope it changes one day, but... He had to have a surrogate culture too. I think we've got that. Let's have a listen. Why do you think there is this big taboo in male professional football about being gay? I think it comes down with a lot of footballers want to be known as, like, masculinity. And I think being gay, a lot of footballers want to be known as masculinity. And I think being gay, a lot of people use it as being weak. So a lot of people would say, like, you're doing that because you're gay, and they're going to just say it's because you're weak and it's just not the case. So a lot of people don't want to do that because in football they are masculine and it's something that you can get picked on for. Carolyn, there's an interesting point, that word masculinity, because if you look in Australia there are openly gay female players in footy, AFL, cricket, and that doesn't seem to be a big problem, but with men, masculinity it is. Yeah, which I found really interesting. I just love that young guy. I really do. I think he's one of the strongest people. I thought that was beautiful the way he said, I want people to know the real me. it was interesting to me, too That he said that he thought that some people thought that gay people were weaker Actually some of the gay people that I know are some of the strongest Most reliable honest upright characters in my life. Just fantastic people I think it's problematic that we're having the World Cup in a place like Qatar I really do where Yes, yeah. Where homosexuality is illegal and where there's, I mean there hasn't been floggings and there hasn't been executions but it remains on the books. How terrifying must that be? Why would you want to go to a country like that? And I am warmed by all of the international sportsmen that we've seen, including at Formula 1, where people have stood up against Qatar and said, this is not acceptable and so long as you have these rules on your rule books, is not acceptable and so long as you have these rules on your rule books, we will not play international sport with you. That's also crazy to think that there would be, I mean there has to be at elite levels in male professional sport in Australia, players who still keep their true identity. In some parts of me thinks, well why do they have to come out? Come out is such a strange thing to me, like people are what they. Like, why do you have to kind of announce it in that way? People should just be accepted for what they are. But they feel like they can't reveal their true selves. I think it's a shame because it must be a difficult way to live. Feeling that you have secrets is always a difficult way to live. You should live with as few secrets as possible. It's the best, that's the best way forward. Yeah. All right. Interesting things to talk about. Brooklyn, thank you. Carolyn, thanks again.
