{"text": " What is the fourth industrial revolution and how did we get here? So real quick, TLDR in a nutshell, the fourth industrial revolution is the confluence of several technologies, namely artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, quantum computing, which of course is still ramping up, blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency, spatial web and web 3.0, biotech and genetics, and finally nuclear fusion. Now obviously as I mentioned some of these technologies are still ramping up, some of them are all the rage right now, but basically these six technological domains are going to be what powers the next century of human advancement. So let's get into it. For a little bit of historical context I want to tell you about the previous revolutions and we're gonna start all the way back in the Bronze Age. So the Bronze Age, TLDR, if you're not familiar started about 5,000 5,500 years ago with the introduction of copper and tin being merged to make bronze. So this allowed us to have better tools, better weapons. It was also associated with other technological improvements, such as the invention of the wheel and axle. You might be thinking of chariots that the Egyptians used during warfare. But also wheels and axles were used for farming, irrigation, moving dirt around. Also writing became a really big thing around this time. So whether it was clay tablets or papyrus, writing was used primarily at first for resource coordination and government functions. Of course writing also eventually was used for storytelling and records keeping and a few other things. But all this really started about 5,500 years ago, and this period of time lasted for about 2,000 years until around 1,200 BCE. Now, skipping forward a little bit, ancient Rome. So we fondly remember the Roman Empire for a lot of things, a lot of scandalous affairs and corruption and backstabbing and a lot of really great stories But they're also remembered for their engineering feats namely around stone working and concrete Now above and beyond that because obviously, you know, the Coliseum is still standing the Pantheon many Roman aqueducts and Roman roads So lots of feats of engineering they invented the tread, and I don't know if they invented the tread crane, but basically they made really good use of cranes. They also advanced legal systems and calendar systems. They're really good systems thinkers. Roman law is actually still kind of the foundation of Western law today. So that's how important that was as an innovation. And then of course, the Greek and Roman world, they invented what we now today know as philosophy and history. And what I mean by invented is basically brought the idea of recording all of your thoughts in books in order to preserve and transmit across time and history. Moving forward, after the fall of the Roman Empire, there was a brief dark ages, but it was dark, it was anything but dark for the Golden Age of Islam, and so the Islamic scholars of this period of time between the 8th and 14th centuries, they were really big into reading and writing. They are actually the ones that preserved all the Greek and Roman writing for us today. But even bigger was their impact to mathematics. So algebra literally is an Arabic word. The geometry and algebra that the Arabic scholars contributed in the golden age of Islam still underpins all of science and engineering today. So again, it's been one long continuous thread basically around the Mediterranean. Obviously this is a very Western-centric view. The Eastern world had their own had in isolation it completely independent from the Western world had many of the same innovations. So I am I am very much aware that this is a Mediterranean Western-centric view of engineering and science and technology and the history of industrial revolutions. Moving forward after the much aware that this is a Mediterranean Western-centric view of engineering and science and technology and the history of industrial revolutions. Moving forward after the golden age of Islam is the Renaissance. So the Renaissance was kicked off when we saw the invention of a new information technology, the printing press. So the printing press was the first thing that allowed us to mass-produce intellectual content. And so, functionally speaking, to the human mind, the printing press is not much different from the Internet in that it allows you to mass produce textual information. Now the Internet, of course, adds some functional differences, namely that we can transmit it around the globe instantaneously, but from a cultural and intellectual standpoint, they've had roughly the same effect It's just the internet is bigger and faster some other innovations that happened during the renaissance that are still around today Namely are the banking advancements and then scientific advancements Particularly those developed in the university systems and the guild systems. So basically the modern intelligentsia we see today Kind of got started around the 15th century, late 14th and 15th century in Europe. And that sets the stage for going straight into the first Industrial Revolution. So now that you're caught up to speed, how did we get from there to here? So the first Industrial Revolution started in the 18th and 19th centuries and this saw the first big wave of mechanization and steam power. Now mechanization and steam power largely with textiles and food production, these were static steam engines. So it's basically one way to think about it is that building a steam engine that sits in one place is a lot easier than building a portable steam engine. So the first industrial revolution was mostly about building larger machines in factories. And then of course, bringing people to work in those factories. And so all the all the images that you have of smokestacks and old London, that's generally first industrial revolution. You know, and this was this was marked by a move from the more agrarian lifestyles to moving into the cities. Now, that being said, there is a lot of parallels between the first and second industrial revolution, which we'll get to right now. So the second industrial revolution is the 19th and early 20th century, so much more modern. And so the primary difference between the first industrial revolution and the second industrial revolution is the introduction of electricity and portable steam engines. So this is where you start to see steam ships becoming really popular, steam locomotives, now of course steam engines have been around since the 1700s, but it wasn't until they were scaled up and also with the introduction of internal combustion engines around the early, the turn of the century. But with the advent of electricity and modern chemistry, this gave us a whole lot of new technological capabilities, such as telegraphs and telephones, which completely renovated the way that we were transmitting information to each other. Also with the industrial scale we saw the emergence of modern corporations. So until then all you had were smaller, you know, factory bosses, right? You had small-time capitalists who were able to, you know, build and run a factory, but usually that was the size of a business. But with the second industrial revolution, with mass transit, such as with rail and steamships, corporations started getting much larger in scale, which meant that they had to have much more sophisticated bookkeeping and international law and interstate law had to be advanced in order to match this. And during this period of time, this is when we saw the rail, coal, and steel barons that were infamous during the early 20th century. The third industrial revolution is the move from analog to digital. So this is the primary change here where no longer are we dealing strictly with, you know, fire-based, you know, uses of fuel and energy. We're now in the nuclear age. We have computers, we have digital processing. This is the origin, the origination of the internet, of email, information networks, and also the rise of consumer electronics. Consumer electronics were no longer the domain of business, you know, IBM, International Business Machines. This is where we saw the rise of radio, TV, computers, game consoles, all kinds of stuff, VCRs in the home. And this explosion of information availability allowed for increasingly sophisticated global networks such as global supply chains, as well as international conglomerate corporations. Until this time, it just really wasn't possible to have gigantic megacorps because information was just too slow. So moving forward, now we're at the fourth industrial revolution. So the fourth industrial revolution arguably started within the last five to ten years, particularly with the ramp up of AI and robotics. AI really has taken off in the last couple of years. Quantum computing is still kind of in a nascent phase, so we'll see how fast quantum computing ramps up, but the investment is there. Eastern world and Western world are both investing a lot in quantum computing because the dream is that quantum supremacy will create an exponential speed up of all kinds of things such as material science, medicine, and possibly even solving nuclear fusion and other things. Blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies, these have been around for a little while and they're starting to mature. So for instance, what I mean by that is that the tech giants like IBM and VMware and others are starting to provide enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. It's no longer just the domain of experimental open-source stuff. These are enterprise-grade solutions that are going to be supported by professional engineers and tremendous amounts of investment, which means that the technology is going to become more robust and reliable and trustworthy. Spatial web and Web 3.0. So these are technologies that are based on the saturation of internet signals and other wireless network signals, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. But basically you have sensors and internet everywhere. So now what do you do with it? You have a tremendous amount of information and presence, omnipresence of internet and then of course that extends the reach of artificial intelligence and other things. We still don't really know how this is going to play out, but basically information everywhere, everything can be instrumented and parameterized. Biotech and genetics, some of my recent videos I've talked about how these technologies are advancing. So for instance, technologies like AlphaFold and proprietary platforms are already helping with drug discovery, and not just the drug discovery, but the end-to-end process of drug approvals. And so when you have all these working together, we're going to start to see compounding returns. And then finally, nuclear fusion is another thing that's up and coming. The investment is there already. It's in the billions of dollars. So it's only a matter of time before we solve this problem. Now, of course, it would be incorrect to assume or assert that nuclear fusion will be solved instantly and that it will be instantly commercially viable, so on and so forth. These are technologies that will be refined over time, but the combination of AI, quantum computing, and all of these other technologies will form a compounding returns. What I mean by that is that we will have this kind of snowball effect, this accumulation where they start feeding off of each other in a virtuous cycle or a positive feedback loop. And that is the fourth industrial revolution and that is why it is so exciting. And that is why I have rebranded my channel to be navigating the fourth industrial revolution. Thanks for watching.
