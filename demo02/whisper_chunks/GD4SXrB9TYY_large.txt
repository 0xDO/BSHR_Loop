{"text": " Hey, is this thing on? Okay, cool. So welcome everyone to my inaugural GoPro recording for my lifestyle channel. Today I want to talk about three frameworks to live better. These are things that I have known about for a while, but because I went through burnout and I'm recovering from burnout, I've one, revisited them, and two, I'm actually living by them. Also, I apologize if the wind is getting... I'm about to get closer to the woods again, which should block out the wind. Here, let's see, this is a little... Getting used to this new device. There we go. Okay, cool. Yeah, still there? Okay. So, let's see. Yeah, so the first framework is self-determination theory. This is the simplest one, which is why I wanted to start with it. So self-determination theory is SDT. I don't remember who it was created by, but it is a very, very simple framework that basically says there are three basic psychological needs, intrinsic psychological needs that all people have. Those three needs are autonomy, so individual liberty, autonomy, self-control. The second one is competence or challenge or mastery. So basically, competence is you need to feel like you're good at something. You don't want to feel like an idiot. Nobody likes feeling like an idiot. You like to feel like you're good, which a lot of people get that from their career, right? Because your career might be a way to make money, a career might be a way to demonstrate that you know what you're doing, so on and so forth. And the last thing is connection, human connection. So relationships, friends, family, lovers, children, social groups, so on. Oh, sorry, don't want to blind you. Oh, hang on a second, moved to the other hand. Yeah, so self-determination theory says these are the three intrinsic psychological needs that all people have and How that relates to burnout and Hyperabundance or post-scarcity living or post singularity living however you want to call it Basically When you think of those intrinsic psychological needs in relation to, well, what if we don't work anymore, right? You can say, oh, well, that's actually bad because if you don't have a way to feel competent, then your mental health is going to suffer. And in fact, we do find that is that some people, once they retire, their mental health actually does decline if their sense of competence and mastery is tied up in their job. In my case, I actually had to leave my day job in order to do AI and YouTube and Patreon. So my personal sense of competence and mastery was already disentangled from my day job. So the takeaway I guess is that if you are facing losing your job, or you're trying to prepare for post-singularity life, work on competence in other domains. So one of my best friends that I've had for 15 plus years, avid gamer. He doesn't really care about his perceived competence from the perspective of technology or making money. I'm not saying that he doesn't care, like he makes good money as a VR engineer or whatever it is that he does now. But he has gotten a lot of personal satisfaction from gaming. And it occurred to me, as I was talking about this in my other video, my post-singularity impacts video on my other channel, that video games actually satisfy a lot of our intrinsic needs, which is why they can be so addictive. So one, video games are challenging, right? They are finely calibrated to meet you at your level and to be challenging and so that you feel a sense of mastery. And actually my fiance told me that first, that that's actually, from an information perspective, that is one reason that video games are appealing is that challenge, that sense of mastery. Now, in many cases, video games are also a social conduit. So, like my nephew and his friends, they all play Roblox and Minecraft and whatever else, and they do it as a social thing. So, video games are actually a social glue for many people. Whether you play across the internet or you do parallel play, which parallel play is like I'm playing on my screen, you're playing on your screen, but we're all hanging out playing games. And finally, autonomy. Video games allow you to be anyone or do anything. So they give you a, I'm not going to say a false sense of autonomy, but they give you a sense of autonomy. Now it might sound like I'm saying, Oh, well, post singularity, everyone is just going to be a gamer. That's certainly a risk that some people might focus on gaming. But I was talking with some people at a meetup recently and they're like, yeah, you know, I, I retired and uh, you know, like and, you know, I did the gaming thing for like six months, but then I got bored of it. I got burned out and now I want to do more meaningful stuff. And so finding meaning is something that's not really talked about in self-determination theory. So finding meaning is outside of that framework, which leads me to the other two frameworks. One is called Ikigai, which I've mentioned before. So Ikigai is a Japanese concept, a very, very nuanced concept as most Japanese concepts are that basically roughly means your reason for existing. But there's a lot more to unpack with that. So with Ikigai as a framework, of course we in the West we systemize everything because we're all engineers, right? Ikigai is composed of four overlapping loops or overlapping domains. So Ikigai is that which you can get paid for, that which you love doing, that which the world needs, and what was it? That which you're good at, sorry. So if you're wanting to understand purpose, Ikigai is a good place to start. What is it that you're good at? What is it that you can get paid for? What does the world need? And so on and so forth. Wow, my brain, I can't remember all at once. Anyways, so Ikigai, super useful concept. Lots of other YouTubers have talked about this concept. Also, I'm getting really toasty, so hang on just a second. I don't know if I can pause this. It's like 40 degrees out, but because I'm so warm natured, I get really warm really fast with any exercise. I am well adapted to the cold. All right, so anyways. So ikigai is one way to find meaning. Now obviously if money or jobs are going the way of the dinosaurs, which by and large I think they are, that kind of invalidates some of Ikigai, right? Especially if you look at a post-singularity world where, you know, where AI takes over most of what humans even need, right? But, but you can look at a smaller scale. So what I mean by that is there's gonna be people in your life that have needs, right? Your friends, your family, your parents, your children, whatever. So those people have needs. And so by working with them to help satisfy their needs and what they need and what they want, you can also derive more meaning. So that's one framework. The last framework that I wanted to talk about was Roger Walsh's TLC or therapeutic lifestyle changes. So this is a more comprehensive framework. It's got eight factors. I'm certainly not going to remember all of them, but it's like rest, relaxation, recreation, diet and nutrition, exercise, time and nature, spirituality or religion, giving back, that's already eight. I think human connection or relationships, anyways, I probably misstated it. Anyways, it's a far more comprehensive Framework also, I apologize there's construction. I hope it's not drowning you out. But yeah, so I Learned about teal Roger Walsh's TLC's many many years ago back on the days of stumble upon and That was a very useful framework for me just to like oh, yeah, these are domains of my life that I'm not addressing. And you know, some of the atheists out there might be like, spirituality and religion. But I will say that having finally come to understand my own spirituality, you know, breaking out of the Judeo-Christian mold, not that I was raised like that, but you know, breaking out of the Judeo-Christian mold. Not that I was raised like that, but you know, as an American in the South, that's all that we know. So, but you know, with the rise of Neo-Paganism and stuff, I got someone passing. With the rise of alternative or older religions or the you know, re-recre recreation of older religions, so on and so forth, I've had an opportunity to revisit spirituality. And I will say that it's interesting because for me it's more of a social thing rather than a this provides fundamental meaning and answers. Anyways, difficult to unpack all at once. Point being is that there are these three frameworks that are really helpful for mental health and just being happier in general and how they all relate to burnout. You've probably seen my burnout video where I talk about the factors that go into burnout and recovery. And this is where I wanted to get to with this video was there was an exercise that I did a few weeks ago. Was I wrote down everything that I was doing, everything that I thought that I should do, everything that I thought that I should do, everything that I thought that I needed to do, everything that I wanted to do, and I had a list of like nine things. And that was quite a bit, quite a number of things. Each one of them almost was like a full-time job, right? Like YouTube and Patreon, that was one of the items. Writing a novel, that was another item. Working on cognitive architecture, that was another one. Recovering from burnout, right? So I had this laundry list of stuff that I believed that I should be doing, that I thought that I needed to do. And I was like, this is too much. No wonder I'm burned out. And I was burning myself out with recovery from burnout. Which that's just dumb. Don't do that. So then, over time, I whittled that list down. Excuse me. And sorry, there's a lot of pollen. It's springtime. You can probably hear the birds. I apologize. So anyways, so over time, I whittled it down to just the things that I want to do. So well there's one thing that I need to do, which is I need to make money so that I can pay the bills and eat and so on. So the thing that I need to do is YouTube and Patreon. And embedded in that is a lot of my AI research, this video here, so on and so forth. But that's just what I need to do. That's my ikigai, right? But then I was like, okay, well, what do I want to do? So there's two things that I want to do, but there's really only one thing that I really want to do, which is finish my novel. So I work on my novel. That's the, that's the one thing on my list that I really want to do. Everything else just falls naturally into those frameworks. So I'm really active in local meetups. I run two meetups and I'm co-organizer on two more and that that serves a really big social component, connection, finding value in people like me. So I have a lot of internet clout because of my expertise in AI, but all the friends that I've had for years are like, whatever Dave, we don't care. Because I've been ranting about AI for 15 years, so they're like, this is nothing new. None of them are surprised either. But I was like, okay, well, this is something that's actually really important to me that I care a lot about. So I was like, I need new friends who do care about AI. So that's why I created an AI meetup. It's local only, so, you know, it is what it is. But I'm starting to find, like, really good friends in these groups that care about the same things that I care about and think about it the same way that I do. And yeah, I guess that's about it. Sorry, I'm trying to keep the sun behind you so that you don't get any glare. But yeah, so self-determination theory, that one's the simplest one and I keep that in mind. And self-determination theory also explains, at least in part, my burnout. Because autonomy, lack of autonomy, was a big reason for my burnout, both in a corporate world and in my startup, was because when you're as smart as I am, and I'm not gonna apologize for just stating facts, when you're as smart as I am, people want your attention all the time. They want more from you all the time. They see me as basically Gandalf, like, solve all of our problems with the wave of a wand. And I'm like, okay, I can. But then the weirdest thing is people feel entitled to your help. And then when you tell them no, they get really angry. And this happened many, many times throughout my life. They don't take no for an answer. They get angry, they get judgmental. I've talked about this before. But so they basically say, well, but you're the genius, and you have to solve all these problems. And then, so they basically want to deprive you of your sense of autonomy. Which that lack of autonomy is a big contributing factor to burnout. So when I said, no, I'm actually going to keep my genius for myself, I'm going to keep my life for myself, to heck with all of you, I quit. Right, I quit my day job. I am stepping back from the startup. I reclaimed a sense of autonomy. And so this actually reminds me of Nietzsche, who, oh boy, Nietzsche is super problematic. But one of the things that he said was, seek not happiness, seek power. And I think, one, this is a trauma response, because dude had a really miserable life, but there's some wisdom in that. And if you reinterpret seek not happiness, seek power as seek autonomy. Or mastery, or both. You know, power is, you could look at power as the combination of mastery and autonomy and in our neoliberal society Neoliberalism is the prevailing Mentality around capitalism of private ownership and and so on and so forth money equals liberty You have to earn your personhood Through economic means the more money you havehood through economic means. The more money you have, the more free you are. The more money you have, the more power you have. So in some respects you could interpret Nietzsche's words as seek money because money gives you more choice, more autonomy, more power. And earning money can be a great way of feeling competent. Now, you can get lost in that because if you have a lot of trauma, then no amount of money or power or autonomy will ever be enough. That's a whole other can of worms. Let me know if you want to talk about that. Let's see, going down a lot of rabbit holes. So, but yeah, so thinking of autonomy, like what does it mean to be autonomous? I've got some more folks come in with a puppy dog, trying not to capture anyone on camera without their consent. So instead, we'll look at ducks. I don't know if you can see the ducks through the woods. Because consent is important. Consent is actually a really big component of autonomy. If people don't respect your consent, or don't care about your consent, they intrinsically don't respect your autonomy. This video is ending up being a lot more about autonomy than I thought it would be. So yeah, so autonomy, that was, I guess the reason I'm talking about it is because autonomy was the big thing that was missing from my life, was that, you know, my 9 to 5 job, my boss respected my autonomy, but the corporation as a whole did not. And that's true of all corporations, right? They want to own your time, they want to own your mental labor, they want to own your output. They want to own as much of you as they can. Why? Because that's how corporations make money, and corporations are intrinsically amoral. They only slap autonomy on like, Oh! Work-life balance! We care about work-life balance! Because it helps get more employees in the door. I'm walking and talking really fast. Again, trying not to show any people or any houses, because I want to respect people's autonomy and privacy. So I think that's about it. Yeah, autonomy is critical, connection, competence, mastery. Honestly, of those three frameworks, self-determination theory for me is the most useful right now because one, it's simple, and two, it covers a really wide breadth of things. So alright, I think that's it. Thanks for watching. So, alright, I think that's it.
