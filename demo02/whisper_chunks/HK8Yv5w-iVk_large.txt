{"text": " You know how I know I'm getting old? This is embarrassing, but I was in my hotel room. I'm not gonna lie, I was jerking off. Like, and I was like really sweating it out. And this is when I knew I was old. I just gave up in the middle, like nothing even happened. I'm like. I don't like looking at my dick anymore. My dick looks distinguished. It's old, an old looking dick. It's got salt and pepper hair all around it. My dick looks like Morgan Freeman in the 90s. Without the dots. My dick narrates. Dave pulled me out and started jerking me around and jerking me around. But not with the same vigor as when he was young. He and I both knew nothing was coming out. I see my age and my children. I came home from the road. This is not long ago. I've been gone for a few, picture I was gone for weeks and weeks. And when I came back, nobody was home. Now one person in my family thought that maybe I'd like to see them when I got back. Like, they knew when I was coming back, but they just weren't, they just weren't home. And that shit was a wake-up call. You know, like when my kids were little and the tour bus would pull up to the house, these motherfuckers would spill out. Dad, it's home, hooray! And they'd hug me and kiss me, and then as the years went on, they'd get less interested. Hey, everybody, look, it's Mr. Promises, back from the road. But empty house, that's some cold shit. And I went into my oldest son's room. I was like, hello, hello. He was gone. And I'd never done this to him before, but for some reason I just did it. I just looked through his shit. Just to see who this motherfucker was becoming. And I found these notebooks, and I started going through the notebooks, and it was all this weird shit. And I found these notebooks, and I started going through the notebooks, and it was all this wonderful poetry in them, written as his handwriting. I didn't even know this nigga wrote poems. And then I looked through his drawers, and I opened up his middle drawer, and I found his rolling paper. And I looked down at them papers like, oh, that's where that poetry's coming from. And that shit broke my heart. I mean, I smoke weed, but I mourned my son's innocence. And I cried a little bit. And I took his papers upstairs to my room. Rolled some weed that I'd hid from the family. And I got really high. And then I got paranoid, so I put his papers back how I found them. So he wouldn't know what I was up to. This nigga won't even know that that happened until he sees the special. Yeah, nigga, I found your papers. He's a cold motherfucker. Let me tell you, this kid is only 16 years old. Listen to what he did to me. This motherfucker calls me up in the middle of the night. It was 1 o'clock in the morning. He goes, Dad, don't be mad. I knew something was terribly wrong. I said, what's going on? He said, listen, I'm fine. And don't forget, you told me to do this. I'm at a party, and my designated driver had too much to drink. Me and my friends need you to come pick us up. I said, Jesus Christ, it's 1 o'clock in the morning, nigga. I am shit-faced. -\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a But I figured, fuck, it I'm coming to get you. I said, give me the address and I'll be right there. And then he gave me the address and I was shocked. I said, son, you are not going to believe this, but I'm at the same party, nigga. I'm at the same party. I'm at the same party. I'm at the same party. I'm at the same party. I'm at the same party. I was shocked. I said, son, you are not gonna believe this, but... I'm at the same party with him. -\u266a\u266a Bye!", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 1.12], "text": " You know how I know I'm getting old?"}, {"timestamp": [1.12, 5.04], "text": " This is embarrassing, but I was in my hotel room."}, {"timestamp": [6.6, 8.64], "text": " I'm not gonna lie, I was jerking off."}, {"timestamp": [8.64, 12.08], "text": " Like, and I was like really sweating it out."}, {"timestamp": [15.0, 17.12], "text": " And this is when I knew I was old."}, {"timestamp": [17.12, 19.68], "text": " I just gave up in the middle, like nothing even happened."}, {"timestamp": [19.68, 20.52], "text": " I'm like."}, {"timestamp": [32.28, 33.84], "text": " I don't like looking at my dick anymore.
