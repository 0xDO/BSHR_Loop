{"text": " All right, if you want an artificial intelligence YouTuber that really is thinking deep about robotics and what the future is gonna be like, then you might be interested in David Shapiro, tilde or approximately AI. He's not polarizing, but he has like a strong opinion and he thinks through things with like presentations and I absolutely love and it gets my mind going in all these crazy places when I watch his content. But let's hop over to his about section, see how he describes himself. I research AI cognitive architecture based on natural language and LLMs. I also build automation tools and products with cutting edge AI. Lastly, I conduct interviews with thought leaders and industry veterans. Sometimes he does presentations too. So he's got a video where he's saying how close are we to Westworld? And I remember watching the whole thing thinking like, this is so interesting. Doomerism, denialism, optimism. Let's rank him by most popular. What's his most popular vid? Post-singularity predictions, how will our lives, opportunities, and nations adapt to the AI revolution? Ah, big question. We'll have to take it day by day, but I'm glad people like David are even thinking about it.", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 2.34], "text": " All right, if you want an artificial intelligence YouTuber"}, {"timestamp": [2.34, 5.26], "text": " that really is thinking deep about robotics"}, {"timestamp": [5.26, 6.7], "text": " and what the future is gonna be like,"}, {"timestamp": [6.7, 9.02], "text": " then you might be interested in David Shapiro,"}, {"timestamp": [9.02, 11.5], "text": " tilde or approximately AI."}, {"timestamp": [11.5, 14.06], "text": " He's not polarizing, but he has like a strong opinion"}, {"timestamp": [14.06, 16.44], "text": " and he thinks through things with like presentations"}, {"timestamp": [16.44, 18.98], "text": " and I absolutely love and it gets my mind"}, {"timestamp": [18.98, 21.38], "text": " going in all these crazy places when I watch his content."}, {"timestamp": [21.38, 22.68], "text": " But let's hop over to his about section,"}, {"timestamp": [22.68, 23.98], "text": " see how he describes himself."}, {"timestamp": [23.98, 25.96], "text": " I research AI cognitive architecture"}, {"timestamp": [25.96, 27.86], "text": " based on natural language and LLMs."}, {"timestamp": [27.86, 29.44], "text": " I also build automation tools"}, {"timestamp": [29.44, 31.2], "text": " and products with cutting edge AI."}, {"timestamp": [31.2, 33.18], "text": " Lastly, I conduct interviews with thought leaders"}, {"timestamp": [33.18, 34.28], "text": " and industry veterans."}, {"timestamp": [34.28, 35.84], "text": " Sometimes he does presentations too."}, {"timestamp": [35.84, 37.04], "text": " So he's got a video where he's saying"}, {"timestamp": [37.04, 38.52], "text": " how close are we to Westworld?"}, {"timestamp": [38.52, 39.84], "text": " And I remember watching the whole thing"}, {"timestamp": [39.84, 41.8], "text": " thinking like, this is so interesting."}, {"timestamp": [41.8, 43.72], "text": " Doomerism, denialism, optimism."}, {"timestamp": [43.72, 44.84], "text": " Let's rank him by most popular."}, {"timestamp": [44.84, 45.84], "text": " What's his most popular vid?"}, {"timestamp": [45.84, 47.34], "text": " Post-singularity predictions,"}, {"timestamp": [47.34, 49.72], "text": " how will our lives, opportunities, and nations"}, {"timestamp": [49.72, 51.46], "text": " adapt to the AI revolution?"}, {"timestamp": [51.46, 52.3], "text": " Ah, big question."}, {"timestamp": [52.3, 53.14], "text": " We'll have to take it day by day,"}, {"timestamp": [53.14, 54.96], "text": " but I'm glad people like David are even thinking about it."}]}
