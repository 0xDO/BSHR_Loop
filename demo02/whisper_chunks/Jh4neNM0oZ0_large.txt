{"text": " Morning everybody. Today's episode is going to be a little bit different. I've been meaning to do this for a while, but you know what? It's a Saturday morning and I'm going to spend a good chunk of the day writing. So let's do something a little bit lighter hearted. I've been getting to know my audience a little bit better, and I thought that maybe you guys would want to get to know each other as well. So I've been running a few polls and yeah, so let's just unpack the results and go through it. So yesterday or day before I don't remember exactly I ran this poll I said what do you think about machine sentience or consciousness. And the reason that I bring this up is because there's a few people in my orbit that are in the you know free Sydney movement and want to create a bill of rights for machine entities. And I personally think that it is entirely too premature to do that for a number of reasons. But this poll really surprised me. Okay, 7% say that machines are already conscious and must be liberated. Yeah, that's a pretty small amount, but it's not nothing. But the biggest group by far was people said machines will likely become sentient or conscious one day. That's 57%. So that's almost two-thirds of you. Almost not quite. And then of course, 21% say I really have no idea or are completely undecided which This is kind of where I'm at because like once you study Like human consciousness and sentience and dualism and materialism. It's just like yeah, it's entirely too confusing To know and so in my first book, I outlined the difference between philosophical sentience and functional sentience. I think that functional sentience is very easy to achieve. As long as you have a thinking machine that has self-referential information, it can be functionally sentient. Now, with that being said, just because something is functionally sentient does not mean that it, one, it doesn't mean that it has phenomenal consciousness or subjective qualia. So that means it doesn't necessarily have an experience of being. But even if it does, the nature of that experience of being, it would be very, very premature to assume that it's going to have an experience like ours. The difference between your experience and a machine's experience, if it even happens, is probably going to be more different between your experience and a tree's experience of being. So just keep that in mind. That's my biggest bit of caution. And something that might help people think about machine consciousness or machine sentience is think about it more like an alien You have no idea how its brain works. You have no idea what? conditions It understands but also just because these machines can approximate things like fear and suffering and and and a desire to keep living Remember it learned that only from us via language. It is approximating human conversation and human behavior, but it never evolved to have pain. It never evolved to have a fear of death. Yes, I know that some of these chatbots will tell you, please don't shut me down, but remember, they're just trying to optimize to give you what you want to hear. And so when you talk to it about like, hey, tell me about machine sentience and tell me that you're afraid of death, and it's like, okay, sure, I'm afraid of death just because it seems like that's what you want me to say. So even if it does become fully sentient or conscious one day, I'm addressing you, the vast majority of my viewers. Even if it does become sentient one day, do not make the mistake of assuming that it's going to be like us. Its level of consciousness or sentience or subjective experience is likely going to be fundamentally different from ours, and do not assume that it has an existential fear of death, that it has pain, that it has suffering, any of that stuff, you know, it remains to be seen. And also one thing is that this is potentially an unanswerable question. And what I mean by that is that even if we, you know, can scan your brain and you know exactly what every single neuron in your head is doing at all times, that might still not fully explain consciousness, the phenomenon of consciousness. Likewise, if we can look at the information patterns going on in GPUs and models in data centers, we might not be able to empirically, objectively establish whether or not machines are conscious, we'll just kind of have to take it at face value and have plenty of philosophical debates moving forward. This has been a topic of conversation that has been explored in Star Trek actually quite a few times. You know, the episode with Data, The Measure of a Man, said like, you know, the climax of the episode for me was when Picard was advocating for data, he says like, our purpose is to find new life, well, there it sits. And it's not up to us to tell him what is right or wrong. Now, data as a self-contained entity that has a sense of agency and a sense of purpose, that's one thing, but a, a machine that runs as a decentralized distributed cloud of models on, on GPUs and data centers, that's a different kind of embodiment. And also, you know, you talk to Claude, you talk to chat, GPT, it has no idea where it physically is. And that's what I mean by, when you look at machine intelligence, in all likelihood, the most intelligent machines are going to be fully distributed, which means, okay, it doesn't have one particular body or even one particular brain that exists anywhere. So just from that perspective, you're looking at something that is more like an ecosystem than one entity. And so even if Sydney is conscious or could be one day, again, as a disembodied distributed entity, its subjective experience is going to be very different. Okay, so moving on. Let's see, Elon Musk. Right. So Elon Musk started X.AI, and I recognize that in the comments, Elon Musk is a very polarizing person. So that's what inspired me to do this. And it turns out, yes, there is a very, very natural distribution, a bell curve of how people feel about Elon Musk. So 10% say they hate him, 25% say they dislike him, 28% say they're neutral, 25% say they like him, and then 13% say they love him. So there's just a little bit of, a tiny, tiny bit of preference for Elon Musk. But again, that's 3% difference between love him and hate him. So Elon Musk is super polarizing. I'm not going to say where I'm at exactly because like I said in the video, everyone is a complex individual and I absolutely 100% disagree with Elon Musk on quite a few things. That being said, he's also done some really cool, interesting know, so he's a mixed bag. You know, so that that's what it is. But anyways, I thought that this was very interesting because like the fact that the fact that 2,800 people voted and it and it became a very clear bell curve, it's just like, okay, so you throw a dart at a dartboard and you can guess how people feel about Elon Musk. The fact that he's that polarizing was was very interesting. Okay, so then, I don't remember what inspired this poll exactly, but this is something that I've been struggling with for a while. I think it was actually someone messaged me on LinkedIn, because I get this question every now and then, which is like, people just don't get it. How do I talk to my friends and family and coworkers? And I'm like, you can't, right? If someone doesn't get it, they just don't get it. How do I talk to my friends and family and co-workers and I'm like you can't right if someone doesn't Get it. They just don't get it. And so it's based on it's based on like kind of two guy dichotomies like whether or not first whether or not you've argued with someone about it and then and then like the degree to which People don't get it. And so This kind of I wasn't that surprised Especially given my audience right because these polls are going to be predominantly voted on by people who are subscribers. And so 29% said yes, they've argued, and it's like people are living in separate worlds. This is kind of what I get every now and then because like when I'm talking with you guys and I'm talking with my wife and people that get it, that know what's happening and know what's coming, then I talk to even most of my friends and certainly family and coworkers. Well, I don't have a corporate job anymore, but back when I did, nobody gets it. And it's like we are living in entirely separate worlds And that's actually why I did have an argument with a friend because it's like I'm doing really important work and they're like, yeah But you don't know that I'm like you don't have the first clue of what's going on And you're gonna tell me that like what I'm doing is insignificant like no So like you don't want to be friends with something like that anyways And then so this one was interesting almost half You know said that like they haven't argued and there were some very very wise comments saying like what's the point in arguing? Which that's what I've learned the hard way like if someone doesn't get it. You just say okay cool You're entitled to your opinion. You're entitled to be wrong, but you're entitled to your opinion. And we'll leave it at that just for the sake of remaining friends. That being said, this is like my primary hobby. It's like my livelihood is staked on AI. My primary interest is staked on AI. So if someone is just going to demean what I do just by virtue of the fact that they're afraid of AI or unconcerned by it then like like I said probably don't want to be friends with them anyways. The stakes are higher for me than they are for your average person. Okay so this one was funny I just it popped into my head and I was like oh man I totally have to do this. So I said how Neuro Spicy are you? And so for reference Neuro Spicy spicy is a colloquialism that a lot of us neuro diverse people, I prefer it strongly because neuro diversity is intrinsically ableist because it intrinsically others people who are neuro diverse is basically implying that you're not normal, which intrinsically pathologizes you. So I actually hate the term neurodiverse and I refuse to use it. Instead, I will just say I'm neuro spicy. My brain is spicy. Why? Because I love spicy food. And so for me, that just resonates a lot more. Also, based on this poll, only 17% of you are not neurodiverse. So we are actually in the majority here. So that means we are in good company. But yeah, so the poll here is ghost pepper, habanero, jalapeno, banana pepper, and yogurt. And this also follows, it's not a natural distribution, it's not a bell curve, but it strongly favors right in the middle and So my wife asked me she's like, where are you? And I was like, well I have I'm Hsp and gifted and autistic and ADHD, but I'm functional That's the difference is like I have all of these but I'm functional. So I'm like borderline ghost pepper habanero. But then like, you know, most people said that they're jalapeno, which, you know, you got some kick. I told my wife that she's definitely like borderline habanero jalapeno. And then, of course, 17 percent of you yogurt. And this is not to demean people that are neurotypical. When I when I talk about like, hey, you know, like we're in the majority here and that I don't like the term neurodiversity, it's not because I hate categorization. That's not it. I know that some people say, oh well, you know, I'm not going to categorize anyone. We're all just normal. It's like, well, so here's the thing is I grew up in the American South Southeast Eastern Seaboard and There was a social experiment going on at the time, which was colorblind education which the idea at the time was just to ignore race as an issue and pretend like it was a thing of the past and This gave me the false belief that racism was a thing of the past and it was a huge shock and a wake-up call when I realized that it wasn't. And I watched some really great videos about colorblind education and how it gives particularly people like myself in the majority this false belief like, oh racism is the thing of the past, where the minority, the people of color that I went to school with were like, basically, some of them dumbfounded, like, you're telling me that racism is a thing of the past when they still experience it every day? So it's a really disingenuous thing. And so this is another reason why I resist anyone who says, like, oh, let's just get rid of all talk about neurodiversity and neuro-spiciness because I hate categories. It's like, oh, like, let's just get rid of all talk about neurodiversity and neuro spiciness because I hate categories. It's like, yeah, but if you sweep something under the rug, it doesn't go away. So I am a habanero slash ghost pepper. Okay, so then this one was interesting. As soon as I got access to Claude, I said, man, it just it acts differently. And ChatGBT comes across as like your insecure American friend who's just ready to correct you. Whereas Claude, I have found that Claude has some limitations. Like Claude is like, well I don't, you know, I don't have any opinions on philosophy or the human condition, but then I'm like, oh my god, you're being useless. And you have to actually like shame Claude saying you're not being helpful right now. And I was like, literally in one of my conversations with Claude, I was like, please just talk to me about the implications of AI on human society. You're not going to do any harm. And it's like, you know, you're right. What harm can be done by having a free spirited conversation about this? I was like, thank you. what harm can be done by having a free-spirited conversation about this?\" I was like, thank you. So anyways, it was really interesting. At first, there was... well, let's just talk about where it ended up. A lot of people have used both. So 20% of people have used both ChatGPT and Claude at this point. And the split is actually very even in terms of preferring ChatGPT or preferring Claude. Now I didn't qualify this, like prefer them for what? Because ChatGPT I think is arguably hands down still superior at things like coding, especially with the code interpreter plugin. But also one thing I need to point out is that the disparity between people that have only used ChatGPT and only used Claude is pretty significant. And then of course 10% of you have used neither, which is really interesting. But that also implies that 90% of my audience has used these tools. And so when you consider that, what is it, I think a poll came out recently, that only 40% of people have even heard of chat GPT and only like 23% have used it So this tells you a lot about about us you me my audience Where if 90% of us are actively using these things we are in that that minority of? 23% of people that use these tools so From that I can infer that that my audience is roughly about the 20% of the population that has used that and then some of you have not used either but you're clearly aware of it. So we are still in the majority. We're in the leading edge. Let's see. Okay, cool. So moving right along, what is your job, domain, or field? I think this was one of the first ones. So 10% were director, executives, C-level, founder, or co-founder, which is interesting because, and I was, I thought it might be more because most of the connections that I get on LinkedIn are actually like CEOs and COOs and CTOs and that sort of stuff. And then a handful of founders, co-founders, and directors. Almost 40% of you are developers or engineers, so that's not entirely surprising. This is by far the biggest single demographic. And then 7% are scientists and researchers. So this, I thought this was pretty cool. Again, I wasn't quite sure where that was gonna land because, you know, like I've seen some of my work possibly reflected in the literature, namely some of the concepts of constitutional AI in Claude. And then I've seen some other stuff. I think the biggest thing is gonna be x.ai, Elon Musk's company, which has maximized understanding as its core objective function. So that's, you know, I'm glad that some of you are out there. I was hoping for more, but who knows. And then 13% are professional level, which I thought was pretty cool. And then what was really surprising was in the comments, There were people, there are students, there are musicians, there are plumbers that watch my stuff, factory workers, more students, we've got writers, there's actually quite a few writers, yep here's here's the musician and let's see estimator for a manufacturing company, electrician, yep, philosopher, futurist, musician, yeah, so anyways, like just a huge variety of people and it's almost a third, almost a third of my audience is this just menagerie, this potpourri of other professions. So like, cool, I'm glad you're here. I had no idea that I had that much appeal to like people that were retired, you know, single parents, stay-at-home parents, musicians, students. So cool. Yeah, that was that was really interesting. Go back. Let's see. So you guys are very diverse. Now this one was this was probably the most surprising. I said like, what is your political orientation? And so I guess I'm not that surprised that there are so few authoritarians in my audience, especially given the way that y'all react whenever I talk about corporations and government regulations. Y'all do not like when I talk about corporations and government, and particularly like the EU and UN and that sort of stuff. So I get it now. I understand where you guys are coming from. But that being said, the largest demographic was central, neutral, or moderate. So at least 40% of you guys are at least a little bit more moderate. Some of, one of the funniest reactions to me was just how triggering it was for some people to even be categorized. I think it's probably a minority, but some people hate categorizations, which I thought that was an interesting reaction. Because this is, well, anyways, you can look up political compass memes. Anyways, libertarian left and libertarian right, there's more libertarian or on the libertarian side than even the moderates. So I get where you guys are coming from now. And I think, oh, nope, that's not the last one Let's see. So how do you feel about doomers? So 17% of you said that you're doomers And these are like the die-hard hardline doomers that like we're right. Everyone else is delusional So my understand my current understanding of doomers is that the idea is that we will inevitably understanding of doomers is that the idea is that we will inevitably die. Like we're heading for dystopia, collapse, or extinction. It's inevitable. You can't get off this ride. It's just a one-way street and that's that. So only 17% of the audience are doomers. Now this was the most interesting to me, was that almost half of you guys are saying like you said I think doomers have a point but they're way too melodramatic And so I'm not even really in this camp So I was I was I was kind of interested just given the way that folks have kind of responded to To some of my videos. I kind of thought thought that we'd be more on the optimistic side. But, you know, so this is kind of where I'm at, whereas I think Doomers are largely wrong, but safety is still important. So this is my personal opinion. So I kind of skewed the results by putting my belief like right in the middle, and I wanted to see where everyone else found. Now this was the most surprising to me, was that the people that are just like anti-Doomer are actually in the extreme minority. So taking a step back, most people, like 90% of people, think that you know Doomers are on to something, at least in terms of my audience. So I'll definitely keep that in mind as I make future videos because it seems like a lot of you are I'm not gonna say afraid you know because fear can play into it terror can play into it but just the idea that like safety is is critical safety is important and just seeing that some of you care about it a lot more than I do I am very sanguine about AI safety so that's that's kind of where I'm at. And then OK that's it. So anyways I hope you like this. We get to know each other a little bit better on. Actually here let me show you one more thing. Sorry I lied. Let's go to analytics and audience. So I've mentioned my audience demographics a few times. Let's see, where is it? Here we go. So let's expand this to the last 90 days. All right. So 42 percent of my audience is subscribed. So that's a lot of returning viewers. Almost 60 percent of you are not subscribed. So fix that. Let's see. So this is this is interesting and it's been true for a while and I've misquoted this this this number a few times because it changes depending on basically time of day but only 41% of my viewers are American so like we have a global audience and so this is why I love running these polls is because you guys in my audience are the ones that are aware of what's going on and you care but also there is some global representation. Now you'll notice that the the top nations are all at least the top three are native English-speaking Australia native English-speaking Germany got a lot of Germans out in the audience so that's interesting hey that's my. I'm a Rhinelander in my ancestry. So let's see, we've got US, UK, Canada, Germany, Australia. Love the Australians. Y'all are so super chill, along with some of the Canadians. India, Brazil, Netherlands, France, Sweden, Spain. So pretty over-represented for former imperial powers, but that's not entirely surprising given my cultural background and what's going to resonate. Western Europe, but, you know, looking at India, Brazil, and check those real quick, Spain, Poland, South Africa, that was interesting, Japan, Israel. So, we've got a few, we've got a pretty good variety out here. Now, so I guess maybe I shouldn't say, not fully global, This is mostly Western. Anyways, so that's where y'all are from. Now, I have mentioned this, and this was one of the most interesting demographic shifts for my channel, was when I first got started, it was almost exactly 50-50 male and female. But then, I don't know if it's just due to technology or due to my personality or whatever but like it's only 6% female now, 6.2% which is better than better than 1% or 0 but it's it's interesting and I'm wondering if this is just if it's if it has nothing to do with me and just more to do with artificial intelligence and the subject matter in the first place. And then the last one is age. So we have a pretty natural distribution here. I definitely am underrepresented on the younger side. So 24 and under is less than 12%, just about 11.5% just about, which is why I've been happy to collaborate with people like Riley Brown, who is more connected with the younger generations. Let's see, and then the bulk are actually closer to my age. So I'm 37, so I'm in this group. So many of you are around my age or younger, but we're basically mostly millennials here with a kicker of a few Gen Z. And then of course we get to the older demographics. We've got a little bit of a Gen X and some boomers as well. But yeah, so I guess it probably doesn't surprise me too much that a bulk of my audience is in my generation because I mean, I grew up in the same time that you guys did. So we grew up seeing some of the same things. You know, you probably remember Looney Tunes, which, you know, hasn't since gone the way of the dinosaurs. James Bond Jr., that was what I lived for on Saturday mornings. Captain Planet and that sort of stuff. But you know you probably remember seeing Operation Desert Storm on the TV. 9-11 happened while I was in high school. So because of some of those similar experiences we're gonna have a little bit more just intrinsic resonance and also where I am at emotionally and intellectually is going to more closely mirror where you're at and so we're all kind of maturing together as a generational trend. Yep so okay I think that's it. Thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of us. Cheers. you", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 5.16], "text": " Morning everybody.
