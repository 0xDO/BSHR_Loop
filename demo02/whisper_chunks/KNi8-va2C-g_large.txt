{"text": " Good morning everybody. David Shapiro here with a video. So many years ago I was listening to or watching a video about the founders of Google and they made a joke that success breeds litigation and that little mantra, that truism has really kind of stuck in my mind for many years. And it is proven to be true for OpenAI. So I wasn't going to make this video until I saw that like, OK, there's a few things stacking up. So first, there's the class action lawsuit against OpenAI. So this is public filing, which has 15 allegations, 15 causes of action. And it's also got a handful of plaintiffs. So I'm not a lawyer, so first I just need to say that everything I say here is my amateur, novice opinion. I did, however, talk to a lawyer friend of mine about civil procedure and how they might go about defending this. So I do have a tiny bit of understanding, but, and I'll also walk you through the process of what I have done. Anyways, so with all that framing in place, this is the class action lawsuit. It's 157 pages, which is quite a bit, and it goes through all kinds of spicy stuff. Some of it seems kind of unrelevant, like they're citing Stephen Hawking, who is dead, so I'm like, okay, I know that like they're trying to provide some context, because here's the thing is, in conferring with my lawyer friend, he said that the primary audience of this kind of thing is the judge. So the judge is going to read this and so you have to provide enough context so that the judge understands what's at stake here. Now, with all that being said, they cite stuff like Stephen Hawking and other people talking about like the existential risks of AI to humanity and then dive into civil complaints, which I'm like, okay, these don't seem necessarily related, but they also talk about stuff that is specifically germane to openAI. For instance, the fact that openAI started as an open source non-profit company and as Elon Musk pointed out, now neither of those is any longer true. So you see that right here. Open AI was originally founded as a nonprofit research organization with a single mission. But then it abruptly restructured itself. And of course the way that it is the way that it is worded is meant to be a little bit inflammatory because again you have to make it seem like yes the plaintiffs have a case here. And so from a procedural standpoint, what my lawyer friend said, is that if you're defending against this, first you try and get it thrown out on procedure. Is it filed in the correct court? Do the plaintiffs have standing? And that sort of thing. And they're like, if you have statutes versus procedure, like you can win just on procedure. So probably what's gonna happen is OpenAI, their lawyers, their counsel is probably gonna try and get it dismissed just on grounds of like, the plaintiffs don't have standing, that sort of thing. So one thing that was observed very quickly is that the plaintiffs here are all pseudonyms. It's just it's just their uh their I can't say the word pseudonyms they use pseudonyms there we go um rather than their full names and they actually explain in this complaint that the reason that they did that is because in other cases, when class action lawsuits have been brought against tech companies, some plaintiffs have had death threats and have had to go into hiding or otherwise seek protection. And so they argue that using pseudonyms is legitimate here because it's generally in interest of their safety. But of course, because we are a court system that values transparency, these filings have to be made public. So that's the first one. And oh, and before we move on, some of the complaints are, some of the allegations are violations of electronic communications and privacy, violation of Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, violation of California Invasion of Privacy, unfair competition, Illinois' biometric information privacy, Illinois' consumer fraud and deceptive business practices, Illinois' consumer fraud and deceptive business practices, again, negligence, invasion of privacy, intrusion upon seclusion, I'm not sure what that means, larceny or receipt of stolen property, conversion, I'm also not sure what that one is, unjust enrichment, so unjust enrichment means basically that one party was able to benefit unfairly from something that they received from another party and either I think either didn't compensate them correctly or had no business with that material in the first place. Failure to warn and then New York general business law. So this is this is a very expansive complaint and it is 157 pages. So that's the first one. The second one that came out was Sarah Silverman of all people, who is an actress and comedian, and a few others. So it's Sarah Silverman, Christopher Golden, and Richard Cadry. I'm not sure who those other folks are. So this is also a class action suit, but it's much smaller. It also demands a jury trial. And they didn't list out the infractions quite as cleanly here, but we'll get to how I processed all that. And then finally is FTC versus OpenAI. So the FTC has, this is not a civil complaint, this is an investigation from a regulator, so it's an entirely different venue, entirely different purpose. And basically this is just a demand for evidence and documentation and that sort of stuff. It's a lot, the things that they demand, it's comprehensive down to what data they collect, how they collect it, how they safeguard it, how their authentication works, who they've licensed it to, all kinds of stuff. So it's a very, very wide ranging comprehensive demand, CID. So what is that? Civil investigation demand. And so basically was that civil investigation demand and So basically it's not they're not suing open AI. They are investigating open AI for regulatory compliance and there's a lot of overlap between particularly this this one the FTC as well as the initial class-action lawsuit and so basically what I did was I scraped all the PDFs. And in some cases, if a PDF is correctly printed, then all you have to do is just copy paste the text and then you can use it. Now for the class action one that's 157 pages, it was like 450,000 characters, which is super long. There's also a lot of garbage, a lot of wreckage that ends up in it like all the page headings and stuff and it looks kind of like this where you've got a whole bunch of superfluous stuff. So I used a bunch of regex to clean this up and I got it down to 360,000 characters. So that's still that's still a good chunk of text and it's way way way more than anything OpenAI can consume right now. But it's not more than Claude can consume. So same thing for Silverman. This is a much shorter complaint. It's only 17 pages. Oh, and the core thing about Sarah Silverman's, excuse me, complaint is that it's fundamentally about copyright. In short, they allege that OpenAI used their copyrighted works in the training, and they cite some evidence as to why they believe that happened, and their assertion is that this is a violation of their rights, particularly copyright. And we'll get into more detail about those in just a minute. Now okay, so that's what they allege and those are what I did. For the FTC one, so this is the thing, is the US government is garbage at PDFs. And so you go to the top and it's like, okay, you can't select anything. And then you come down here and it selects it in big giant blocks. And so we saw this for like pretty much every time the US government releases a PDF, it is fricking broken. Whereas here you see like I can just highlight all of it and it's actually correctly formatted. So what I had to do was I had to reprint this PDF using Microsoft PDF printer and then OCR it to get the text out. All right. So, then what I did was I came over to Claude and because Claude allows you to attach it, I said, hey, so this is the Silverman one. I said, can you tell me the main causes of action in this complaint? In other words, what are the main allegations? And so, Claude says, based on my review of the complaint, oh, and by the way, do not use these models to actually defend yourself. I'm just saying, hey, tell me what's in this document. I think that that's a fair and responsible use of language model technology is just tell me what's here. So direct copyright infringement against open AI for allegedly copying and using the plaintiff's copyrighted books without permission to train its AI models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT. Vicarious copyright infringement against OpenAI for the outputs of its AI models like ChatGPT allegedly containing infringing derivative works based on the plaintiff's books that were used in training. Violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, DMCA, for allegedly removing copyright management information from the plaintiff's books when using them to train AI models. Violations of California's unfair competition law. So that's, you know, this is something that's held in common with the other complaint. And I'm not saying that they're working together when I say held in common, I just mean that like they're making similar allegations. Negligence against OpenAI for allegedly breaching its duty of care. So this is another thing, the duty of care and negligence. And then unjust enrichment again. So both of these class action lawsuits cite that. Let's see. Now, the evidence. So interestingly, the Sarah Silverman case does cite evidence and references OpenAI's own papers that discuss training AI models like GPT-1, 3, and 4 on datasets of books, including quote, unpublished books and internet-based datasets. This helps them allege that they copied books without permission. It alleges the size of OpenAI's Books1 and Books2 datasets appears to match the size of known book piracy sites, suggesting OpenAI might have used pirated books. So that is a pretty damning indictment, or allegation rather, because, okay, if OpenAI got on, you know, the Tor network and torrented, you know, book piracy, you know, that could be problematic. It remains to be seen though. Again, as a completely uneducated, wild ass guess, my guess would be is that one, if OpenAI even did that, if they even, if they did pirate books, they might have consulted their attorneys and said, you're not, you're not redistributing these books. And in fact, there is a fair amount of precedent set that consuming data for models is not, like it's not a violation. That basically, if you get text data from the internet, you can always use that for training AI models. Now, if that precedent, one, if I understand that precedent correctly, and two, if it's actually true, that was still set before large language models. So the idea that you could use pirated text for models would have been like for classification, right? For creating a bag of words, classifiers, that sort of thing, not generators. So remember, generative AI is new. So it has not been litigated in the context of generative AI because literally generative AI is only a couple years old. So any precedent that had been set was based on old school technology. So that's my, again, uneducated and only quasi-professional opinion. Okay, so it provides sample outputs from ChatGPT accurately summarizing books written by the plaintiff authors. This helps allege ChatGPT was likely trained on those books. So in this case, I 100% disagree because if the book was discussed on Amazon reviews, on comments, on Reddit, it knows about the book just by virtue of... Oh, it's raining outside. Sorry. If you hear the background noise, it's raining, but you shouldn't. Anyways, sorry. So you can ask it to summarize something that it hasn't read and all it's all it's doing is regurgitating the other summaries that it has already read. And I realized this very early on when I went to chat GPT or GPT-3 before it was chat GPT and I asked it to write the opening lines of like of mice and men or something and it got it completely wrong. It was just guessing, it was just confabulating, so that told me that it hadn't, maybe not of Mice and Men but something more recent and copyrighted, and that told me that it hadn't actually read the book, that it was not in its training data, but that it was that it knew about the book because it had read about people talking about it, but then when I asked it to actually generate the material, it couldn't. So I don't... basically the entire premise of this class action lawsuit could be wrong. It all depends on what's in the training data. But then if it is in the training data, so there's several tests here, if Sarah Silverman's books are in the training data, then it still has to be litigated and there still has to be several tests of, is this actually a copyright violation? Because if it only regurgitates a summary, then who cares, right? If it's not actually, you know, you're allowed to talk about a book, right? But if it's not actually, if it doesn't actually mentally contain Sarah Silverman's actual copyrighted material, then anything that it's producing is just confabulation or hallucination because it thinks it knows about the book by virtue of having read about other people and so it's inferring or imputing about the copyrighted works. Now, that being said, if this is the because this this will come all out in discovery, so from a technical standpoint I would be really curious to know what happens if it one like okay so whether or not OpenAI used copyrighted books might not be the point here because if the model knows enough about the copyrighted material to still infringe upon their rights, that could be a really serious blow to the ability to use open source data sets. Now, that being said, generative AI is generating more text than humans are now. Open AI's models generate literally billions of words per day, probably per hour at this point, honestly. And so, basically what's gonna happen is if, here's what I expect is gonna happen, and I listened to some of the US, United States Congressional hearing on copyright and AI. And so basically what's gonna happen is that if human produced copyrighted material is just too dangerous to use, then every AI shop is just going to switch to 100% AI generated everything, whether it's images, text, music, whatever. And so then you're just going to force them to take humans out of the loop entirely, and you're going to create an entirely separate information domain. That's kind of what I think is going to happen anyways, just because just by sheer virtue of the fact that most digital media is going to be produced by AI before long. Anyways, this could be one of the first components of that. It lists registered copyrights owned by the plaintiff author, plaintiff authors, showing they have valid copyrights. Okay, sure. All right. So, and I, so then I asked like, as a, as a matter of procedure, could OpenAI be subpoenaed or otherwise compelled to share evidence such as their training data? Yes. So here's the thing. Here's what's really going to be interesting is that, now obviously OpenAI has rights to protect their trade secrets and that sort of thing, but they can do depositions, they can serve document requests, they can do all kinds of stuff to try and compel OpenAI to prove whether or not they used this information. So that's going to be really interesting. Again, you know, the courts do their best to try and respect private information, intellectual property, trade secrets, and that sort of stuff. But really the core issue here is a matter of copyright. And then the damages, of course, would be based on, you know, any economic loss there. But also violation of rights. So here's the thing that I'm learning about this is that there has to be an injury to the plaintiff. And the injury could be financial loss, it could be emotional harm, and it can also just be a violation of rights. Like you violated my rights and that is the injury. And so then what I talked about here is this, you know, I said my view is that the model very well could know about the plaintiff's works by sheer virtue of reading about people talking about it on Reddit. It could then infer or impute the contents of the copyrighted material, but that would have to be litigated and come out in discovery. You know, so it's like maybe it just knows about the material and has never actually seen it. And if it hasn't, I suspect that this class action lawsuit is dead in the water. It could get appealed, but really if it comes down to like if they cannot compel OpenAI or provide any evidence that OpenAI used their copyrighted material, then everything else that it is capable of is an emergent capability of the training process. You know, by learning general concepts and styles of writing, allow to convince and generate content in a similar voice, but without copywriting the specifics. Obviously, this is just discussing it. I'm not saying that this is the actual legal test, but just kind of talking about the issue. Yep, so that they would need to prove it. Let's see. Now, the implications, the ramifications of this, which honestly, I personally don't think that the Silverman versus opening I case has much water I don't think I don't think it's airtight But if it does proceed this could be a precedent-setting case and so like The like let's assume for the sake of argument So this is this is something that my lawyer friend told me is, if you just accept it at face value, you say, let's assume that everything that you're accused of is actually true. Is it still going to stand? So here's another way that lawsuits can get thrown out, is like, okay, for the sake of argument, let's assume that all allegations are true or that are factually accurate. It still is not a violation of the law. Because here's the thing, they didn't provide any evidence that CHAT GPT will regurgitate Sarah Silverman's work, and so then it's like okay, if it's only talking about it and in the slight, you know, vaguely similar tone, that's not a violation of her copyright. And if they also, if she can't provide any evidence that she's had financial loss from it, so there's no financial loss, so that's not an injury, so then the case basically hinges on infringing her rights. But again, it didn't ingest it. If it didn't actually take it, then I don't know. I personally don't see it holding up in court, but again, I am not a lawyer. This is not legal advice. This is just my uneducated opinion on the thing. Now, that being said, because generative AI is a new technology, Claude accurately pointed out, courts may have to devise new tests for determining if AI outputs infringe derivatives based on copyrighted training data. Existing legal tests may not apply neatly. So this is, that's why I mean that this might be a precedent-setting case. Because if they do, if it doesn't get thrown out, just outright, then the courts are gonna have to argue and come up with a new test to say, okay, yes, you can write something in the alleged voice of Sarah Silverman and you can talk about her book and you know, you know, like the tone and style and everything. Does that constitute an IP violation? And that will, that could have far ranging ramifications because then it's like, okay, you know, make me an image in the style of, you know, Botticelli or whatever, then if this, if that doesn't stand, then just cloning the style of someone, because the AI model has learned to imitate the style from someone, even if it hasn't seen their work, just by looking at descriptions of it, looking at similar things, then we could see some really, really interesting legal fallout from this. Another thing is there may be ripple effects establishing rights around other kinds of data usage like plagiarism, detection services, scanning student essays. You might have seen in the news recently that all the AI detectors are freaking garbage. There was one AI detector that basically threw out every student essay that was written by a non-native English speaker. So it's like, yay, algorithmic racism. Like if you're not a native English speaker, then like, okay, we're just going to accuse you of plagiarism. And it's like, that's not fair. So we need to be careful about that. That is not an issue here as far as I can tell in the Silverman case. But yeah. All right. So the next one is the big class action lawsuit. So here's the interesting thing is this is 352 kilobytes. And I was able to, and because I was able to get it down to what 360,000 characters, Claude is able to read the whole thing all in one go. So this is really, these tools are going to really accelerate lots of stuff because this is 157 pages of text that it's able to read all at once. And so I said, okay, can you tell me the main causes of action in this complaint? In other words, what are the main allegations? So we already kind of went over that, but like negligence in the development and release of AI products without sufficient testing or safeguards, unjust enrichment, deceptive practices, and lack of transparency, violation of privacy rights. So again, some of it, this one is primarily about privacy rights rather than copyright infringement. And so then it's like, you know, biometric privacy laws. Privacy, privacy, privacy. And so then, you know, does it cite evidence, references expert opinions such as Jeff Hinton, multiple consumer surveys showing expectations of privacy and lack of consent, FTC's recent settlement with Amazon regarding Alexa, California and federal laws like parental consent. So one of the things in the class action versus OpenAI is that children have been able to use it and sign up and that OpenAI didn't do their due diligence to prevent children from using the tool. But again, like, even if you accept that as true, is that actually a legitimate complaint? I don't know. But it's like, you know, children can, you know, order stuff on Amazon just by borrowing their parents' phones. So I don't know. It alleges specific data sources like Reddit that were supposedly scraped without permission based on public comments. Reddit and Twitter, you know, there's been quite a lot going on with Reddit and Twitter and public data or whether or not the data is public. Alleges instances of data usage violations like Snapchat denying the use of location data that ChatGPT then revealed it was accessing. So that's interesting. It references OpenAI's own acknowledgements regarding unpredictability of AI systems. It cites multiple examples of AI harms like defamatory content to establish the risks. So then I asked, what are the primary injuries? Like, what is it that they're actually complaining about that they want relief from? So loss of control over their private data. So again, privacy, loss of autonomy and parental control for data collected from minors, that could be bad. Violation of privacy rights and lack of transparency, exposure to privacy, security, and other risks, such as emotional risk, inability to effectively opt out or have their data deleted, which OpenAI already fixed that such as emotional risk, inability to effectively opt out or have their data deleted, which OpenAI already fixed that because of Italy complaining about chat GPT actually. So thank you Italy for complaining about chat GPT and enforcing GDPR compliance. And then finally loss of economic value of their data, which defendants profited from without compensation to users. So basically they're saying that like, okay, the data that you scraped has value and you're profiting from the data that was ill gotten is my reading of that. Okay, cool. And then I asked about from a civil procedure standpoint, like what is the venue? What is the subject matter jurisdiction? The parties, class action claims, relief sought. That's all pretty straightforward. But really the core thing at issue here is privacy rights and then OpenAI's duty and due diligence. And then finally, the FTC, it's not a complaint, it's an investigation. The FTC investigation is just, you know, like, did they make false and misleading claims about its products capabilities? The FTC is concerned about OpenAI's model might improperly reveal personal information. And remember, there have been those leaks, right? Where chat GPT, like, would suddenly give you information from someone else's chats, which that's a really weird thing. I'm not sure how that happened, because like, like seriously guys, internal data governance, data controls, how do you cross-pollinate user chats, especially when you've got them all identified with UUIDs. That's why you use UUIDs is because they're universally unique identifiers. If it's not the right UUID, don't share that with someone else. Let's see, FTC is concerned with OpenAI's models. Oh wait, no, I already read that one. FTC wants info on OpenAI's data collection, storage, and use practices, including what user data is collected and retained, and how users can access, delete, or opt out of data collection, which of course, they fixed that. It seeks info on OpenAI's model training, including data sources and reviewing and filtering of training data. So again, at issue for all of these complaints is what data goes into the model training. Is it copyrighted? Is it private data? And then how do they protect and safeguard that data? Security practices and data breaches, oversight of third party services built on its API. So this is all their safety constraints and that sort of stuff. There's all kinds of stuff. It's a comprehensive investigation. It's very wide ranging. It doesn't cite anything specific, although I don't necessarily agree with that because it does cite some of the events from OpenAI. For instance, that case of chat GPT leaking conversations. Let's see. Can you describe the investigatory authority that FTC has in this case? Yep. So they can seek information reasonably relevant. Now, here's something that's interesting, and this is again, according to Claude, not an expert, but the FTC is more concerned about operations and procedures rather than the data itself. And so while they do want to understand like basically how it trains its models and where it gets its data, they're more concerned about how that data is then used. Is it a violation of privacy? And what lengths they go to ensure that they are playing above board. Because again, as a regulator, they're not saying like, oh, you hurt someone. This is a more proactive thing. So FTC cannot violate attorney-client privilege. FTC is supposed to minimize burdens on the company by negotiating scope of requests. OpenAI could raise undue burden concerns about producing enormous data sets. And they can also, OpenAI can petition to set aside or modify any of the requests. So basically it's going to be a negotiation between OpenAI and the FTC and if they need to they might get a judge involved. But honestly just because the FTC is a federal agency I suspect they're probably going to negotiate directly. Again, completely uneducated. I don't know if that's actually how it proceeds. Yep. And then I verified my understanding that it's more about procedures. So yes, the document seeks policies, processes, assessments, reports, and aggregate consumer complaints rather than raw data. So the FTC is probably not going to be looking like combing through the training data or the user data, but they do want to see, okay, what do you do with this? And having been through Sarbanes-Oxley audits before, which is more about financial compliance, I will say that, yeah, like if an auditor, they don't really, they're not going to look at the emails. They just want to know, like, is your email server secure? What are you doing to investigate spam and phishing stuff? So it's more of a process and procedure kind of thing. And then finally, oh, I asked about like, okay, if the FTC finds, like finds fault, what can they do? So civil penalties, the FTC can find them, they can do injunctions, which basically says like, stop saying that, you're not allowed to say it that way. Like, if like basically, if the FTC concludes that OpenAI did misrepresent their security practices, or the model capabilities or the training stuff, they might say, you know, hey, you you're not allowed to say that, because we have deemed that that is factually incorrect and we disagree with that characterization. Some corrective actions, and this is what I think is honestly going to be most likely, is that basically if the FTC says that like, hey, you're not handling data and privacy correctly, you need to go fix that. So rather than fining them, they might just say like, hey, you need to do better. Now, with that being said, given how OpenAI has quickly kind of shaped up whenever there's been a problem, I think that they're gonna, I personally think that OpenAI is gonna have a good enough case that they have done their due diligence and they have made good faith efforts in order to, you know, abide by their duty, at least in some cases, not in all cases, but at least when it comes to like data breaches and stuff, because the FTC understands that data breaches happen and that you might accidentally mishandle data. But as long as you have proper internal investigation procedures and that you have done your due diligence, it might be able to kind of toss it. And so here it's like, okay, it's entirely possible that the FTC finishes its investigation and concludes OpenAI did not violate any laws. So that is a completely legitimate outcome. Here's another thing. If OpenAI can demonstrate that it made good faith efforts to comply with laws and norms and addresses any problems that it arose, FTC would likely pursue collaborative remedies rather than punitive measures. So basically, this is gonna be a learning opportunity for both sides, because OpenAI is a small company and it started as a research company and now it's for both sides. Because OpenAI is a small company and it was it started as a research company and now it's for-profit. And for anyone who has interacted with OpenAI versus Microsoft versus NVIDIA versus IBM, OpenAI has not been the best vendor because they they had to make that hard pivot from being a research organization to a for-profit organization. And I know they're technically a capped profit organization, but whatever. The fact of the matter is they went from pure research to now they are a commercial entity. And so part of that is they needed to hire the right people to understand how to run their IT infrastructure correctly, how to design their software architectures to protect privacy and that sort of stuff. Now, the fundamental question here is good faith versus gross negligence. Did open AI always act in good faith and with aboveboard intentions, even if they made mistakes, or did they really drop the ball, or did they willfully or deliberately kind of skirt norms or whatever? That's really kind of what the FTC is gonna be looking for here is, you know, and again, I suspect there probably has been honest mistakes, and OpenAI has demonstrated plenty of energy, in my opinion, to correct some of those honest mistakes. But then, the depth of this investigation, if there is any negligent wrongdoing, I think the FTC is going to find it. Now, the most interesting thing that I think is going to happen is that all three of these investigations are happening at the same time. And so the precedent set by whatever the FTC finds could lend credence or take the wind out of the sails of these other ones. But these kinds of class action complaints and these kinds of FTC investigations take months and months and months. And I suspect they're probably all going to go away quietly. They're probably going to settle if there is any kind of legitimacy to it. But according to my lawyer friend, just on the defense side, you're looking at months and months worth of investigation to pull together documents to do the investigation, to go back and forth with the courts. So we're not probably gonna see any movement on any of this anytime soon, but the fact that we've got this rhyming triplet of complaints that are very similar and have some overlap between them is really interesting. I'm not personally gonna say like, \"'OpenAI is about to implode. Like that's not gonna happen. This is just ordinary, as far as I can tell, having watched everything from the Red Hat and Microsoft antitrust lawsuits back in the late 90s, early 2000s, whenever it was that they finished. This is pretty much run of the mill. Again, success breeds litigation. The more successful you are, the bigger of a target you have on your back. Now, what I will say is, while I am not the biggest fan of some of the decisions that OpenAI has made, I agree with much of what Sam Altman says, and I think that he means well. I think he has good intentions, even if I disagree on execution sometimes. And so I think that he will probably lead OpenAI to say, like, yeah, let's cooperate with the FTC to make sure that we are compliant. Let's demonstrate that we did right by our customers and our training data. Now, it remains to be seen. Some of this stuff will probably not even come out in Discovery again because OpenAI, as far as I know, has rights to protect their trade secrets, which means that they can ask to say, hey, let's exclude this from the data set. Let's keep it off the record. Let's keep it off the filings, that sort of thing. Time will tell. But yeah, so thanks for watching. I hope you got a lot out of this. Also just taking a step back, recognizing that like, hey, I just put like three lawsuits or investigations rather into Claude and one of them was 157 pages long and I had a brief conversation to make sure that I understand it. Like this is incredible. This is a really next-level technology, and we're only seeing the beginning of it. Because again, Claude is 100,000 tokens, but the Microsoft LongNet paper just came out with a billion tokens. So imagine that instead of reading just one class action lawsuit, you can read literally every class action lawsuit in the entire history of the planet. That's what a billion tokens will allow you to do. Maybe not quite every single class action lawsuit, but certainly you could read a lot. And that is part of the difficulty of either filing these class action lawsuits or defending against them, is that you have to look for so much precedent. Anyways, I'm starting to ramble.
