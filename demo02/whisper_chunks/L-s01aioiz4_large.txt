{"text": " Hello, how are you? Hello, how are you? From west to east, north to south, the finish is in sight and every vote on the line. In south-west Sydney, Labor held fouler, Christina Keneally up against independent Dai Le. A poll showing the former Premier not being from the area is hurting her vote. That's not the feedback we're getting at all. They know me from my time as Premier and they're excited to have the opportunity to have a voice at the centre of government. A lot of people actually remember her as the failed Premier of New South Wales and her links to Eddie O'Beat and George O'Pody. The Lay campaign bristling at Labor signs showing her alongside Scott Morrison, her husband confronting a Labor staffer. There's a lot of lies going on here. That's my wife, she's the Independent.

In Warringah Independent Zali Stegall fending off controversial Liberal candidate Catherine Deves. The athlete in me knows you've never crossed the finish line until you've crossed it. While on the south coast in Gilmore, former State Transport Minister Andrew Constance is facing an uphill battle to unseat Labor's Fiona Phillips. It's very serious issues that people are having to contend with and I just think that they don't want a gob full of politics, they've had enough of it. A growing sign of minds made up, the growing number of people voting early, more than 2.6 million so far, that's already more than at the same point during the 2019 election. It's a bit of a schmottle this year. And it's almost over. Paul Caddack, 7 News. And 7 News will keep you informed every step of the way as Australia decides.
