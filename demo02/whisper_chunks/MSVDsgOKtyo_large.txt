{"text": " Hey everyone, David Shapiro here with a new video. It's been a while since I've posted on my life channel because, well, I kept making and deleting videos because they just didn't feel quite right. They felt too salty, too ranty, too rambly, too personal. And so I've been on a personal growth of a personal journey of growth. Sorry. For the last few months, I had a burnout really bad in February. Not the first time, but certainly things have changed because I've made a name for myself on YouTube talking about artificial intelligence. And I don't know if I coined this term, but I've been saying it for many years but when I whenever I do a Google search plenty of other people use this term the burden of competence. So what I did was I realized after a lot of work and talking it out and and doing some deep emotional work figured out this was a major core of my burnout of my resentment of everything else. But anyways so that's why it's personal to me. But this video is going to be more about talking about the burden of competence more broadly more generally. So before we get started I just want to do a quick plug for my Patreon. I've got a few of the higher tier slots available for people that want to have one-on-one calls. I've had people, obviously most of what I talk about is artificial intelligence, but I've even had people call or want to call and, you know, talk about lifestyle stuff, post-nihilism, autism, that sort of stuff. I need to clarify, like, I'm not a life coach, I'm not licensed, I'm not certified, I'm not a life coach, I'm not licensed, I'm not certified, I'm not a therapist, I'm not a counselor, but I'm happy to talk about my experiences as well. So anyways, moving right along. The burden of competence refers to the unique set of challenges, pressures, and expectations experienced by individuals who are perceived as highly competent, intelligent, or gifted in a particular area. It is a multidimensional phenomenon encompassing various aspects of personal, social, and professional life, and it often manifests in such ways as higher expectations and workload, tall poppy syndrome, exploitation, performance pressure, mental and psychological struggles, and pressure to hide or feign ignorance. So there's a lot here. We're going to unpack all of this in quite a few slides. This video will probably take a while. You know, but this is a very clinical, high-level level sterile kind of definition. Again I wanted to kind of distance it from myself and kind of talk about this concept. It took a while to unpack fully and kind of work through the hotter emotions around it because you know this definition is very cool very clinical but the lived experience of the burden of competence is anything but cool and clinical. So moving right along, let's start at a very very high level going all the way back. We're going to talk about the evolution, the neuroscience, the biology of competence or intelligence, talent, giftedness, or intelligence, talent, giftedness, so on and so forth. So in a, in Homo sapiens, in us, the thinking man, the thinking humans, mental abilities are advantageous. They are adaptive, which means that it is something that we select for in our species. In other words, the smarter you are, within reason, the more adaptive that is, the higher fitness you are likely to have. For instance, in our ancient ancestors, the smarter humans would be able to figure out how to make better tools, how to use tools, how to anticipate things, like the movements of herds, the connecting patterns of weather, so on and so forth. And so in ancient times, our curiosity, our intelligence was very, very highly selective. Now, that being said, competence or intelligence is what's known as a cryptic trait. It is not immediately visible, which is why I picked an image of a curvy woman in a bikini as an illustrative example. Many selective traits, many sexual selection traits are highly visible. This is stuff like traits, hip to waist ratio, breast size, height, I think I already said that, physical attractiveness symmetry a lot of aspects of of sexual selection are visible. These are basically peacock feathers. But when you're selecting for traits that are not immediately visible such as intelligence or reliability or trustworthiness you have to look for proxies you have to look for signals or other indicators about those things and this discrepancy the fact that intelligence is both adaptive and desirable but also cryptic is the root of all problems having to do with the burden of competence and we're going to unpack all of that as we move forward. But basically there's a few components of this around cryptic traits. So there's the theory of costly signaling, which is that in order to actually have the trait, you have to demonstrate behaviors that you would only be able to demonstrate if you had that trait. But that gives rise to the possibility of deception, which is basically pretending that you have that trait when you don't actually have that trait. And then the other component of that is social hierarchy establishing a pecking order. And of course there's multiple ways that you can establish your position in a social hierarchy. There's physical dominance there's attractiveness there's social standing but intelligence is one of the components that can speak to someone's or competence more broadly they can speak to someone's social status which is why I have actors musicians and athletes up here at the top because those can be seen as proxies for socially valuable competencies or good genes so with the desirability of these cryptic traits, that gives rise to the evolution of deception and trust. So because it is difficult to ascertain just from a glance someone's trustworthiness or competence, because there's uncertainty, there's gaps but gaps of information. Therefore proxies like reputation social standing are very critical to maintaining and establishing a pecking order. Now that means that if you are truly good right if you're trustworthy if you're reliable if you're likable your reputation should precede you and people can use that as a proxy or a heuristic to say oh hey you know I know that guy he always solves my problem right. You have a reputation of being smart. So that is that is one side. That is how you build trust through social means. But then deception people who take credit for other people's works or are con men or grifters who basically pretend they set up the image, the idea that they are excellent when they are not actually excellent. And so that leads to the evolutionary pressure to have discernment. So gullibility is the other side of that. One of the reasons that humans became so smart and had such good memories, for instance, around the idea of the Dunbar number, which is the ability to keep track of 150 to 250 people in relationships, is because if you're gullible, then you might be taken in by people who are deceiving you, who are pretending, who are virtue signaling things like intelligence, competence, and trustworthiness. And in the context of a social species, pecking order and perceived value is more important than truth or actual competence. And this means that there is a disproportionate advantage to people who successfully grift others than those who maybe don't spend as much time managing their reputation and their perception, but are in fact actually smarter, which is one of the key things that many people who experience the burden of competence actually struggle with, is that we believe that our work should speak for itself, that we shouldn't have to manage our reputation. But then again, there's a lot of global people out there who are going to be taken in by people who make showy examples of their success or dominance. So things like stealing work, taking credit, undermining, sabotaging, devaluing, all kinds of these negative behaviors can actually become beneficial for other people to establish themselves higher in the pecking order than they could otherwise achieve. That goes back to the idea of costly signaling. If you're actually really, really smart, it is easier for you to achieve things that someone who maybe is not as smart or not as competent could do, so they go to underhanded tactics to try and game the system a little bit. We see this most ruthlessly in teens because their prefrontal cortex is not fully developed yet. So basically when you know in the movie Mean Girls and every other teen drama out there where people are vicious and it's boys and girls are viciously attacking and undermining people, they're basically just operating on base social instincts without really thinking about, you know, consequences or how much they hurt people, which is one of the reasons that bullying is such a problem in schools and it has nothing to do with society at large. It is actually just that stage of development and also all of these pressures that are baked into evolution. So one thing that I want to point out is that a lot of these manipulative behaviors continue into adulthood. But one of the things is that people just get better at it. They get better at hiding the manipulation. They get more subtle and nuanced. Whereas people that actually do possess competence they don't actually have to spend that much energy in deception. And so they don't get better at it but you have to get better at detecting it and we'll talk a lot about detection later on. My personal motto is that honesty is always the best policy. Win through genuine excellence. I'm not going to ever spend any time trying to pretend to be anything that I'm not. I'm not going to polish a turd, lipstick on a pig. We've got all kinds of sayings for this in the South. Sometimes it doesn't earn me any friends because, like I said, I'm less concerned about managing my reputation through signaling, but also by unabashedly striving for excellence. It makes me a really big target which we will talk about soon as well. So discernment. I've already alluded to discernment as a critical evolutionary pressure in light of things like trust, reputation, and competence. And so discernment is used for a lot of things like trust, reputation, and competence. And so discernment is used for a lot of things, reliability, trustworthiness, that sort of thing. But discernment is also used for establishing and measuring someone's competence. So a lot of people say, I've got a good BS detector, right? If something smells wrong, you're like, no, I think he's foolish it right. And this is this is an evolutionary instinct where it is advantageous the better you are at detecting deception the less gullible you are which means the less likely you're going to be taken in by someone who's only pretending to be competent by someone who's pretending to be a good leader or smart or a good decision maker or whatever. This is broadly you could call it verification instinct. So basically this this is something that pretty much anyone who has ever stood up and said I have the answer will recognize is that when you stand out you get a lot more scrutiny. And at first I thought what the hell is going on. Why are people scrutinizing me so much. I just showed you my work. It should speak for itself. But the thing is is that when you're an unknown quantity people might not trust the person and therefore they're not going to trust the work and that is of course the basis of ad hominem attacks right. But what I realized after working on this is that this verification instinct this instinct to scrutinize people that you don't have that have not established themselves as being trustworthy is actually part of that BS detector system so that you don't get taken in by false leadership or other grifters or con men and so while it does feel frustrating especially because I know that I did the work I know that I know what I'm talking about. I've got I've documented all my research I've documented the process. I was there when I worked hard to figure it out. But not everyone else saw that. And even if they saw it they might not understand it. And so looking for that social proof is part of that verification instinct which goes to the next point of trust heuristics. So trust heuristics are basically you look for proxies, right? What is this person's social standing? Does someone that I know trust them? There's the web of trust. You also look for other signifiers of competence like what school did they go to? How many followers do they have on YouTube? How many citations do they have so on and so forth. So we look for these proxies we look for these signals that tell you that someone's competence is true right. And even there are plenty of people that have plenty of these signifiers but there's their ideas still don't stand up to scrutiny because they might be really good grifters or they have done a lot of work, performative work to demonstrate the trappings of competence. And so that's where discernment comes in. And because again, competence is a cryptic trait. It is something that you constantly need to measure and evaluate. It's not like, you know, someone's age. It's pretty difficult to hide your age. You can try it with makeup and surgery and makeup and surgery and stuff, but, you know, your age, your height, your skin color, other aspects of physical attractiveness, these are all going to be very obvious traits and therefore harder to hide and also less controversial to talk about. And then, of course, substance over show, costly signaling or the signs of competence that arise that are difficult to fake basically. So by couching all this in the idea that oh well most of the bullying or harassment or pushback that you get under the burden of competence is about discernment is actually very generous. That's only half of the conversation. That's literally only half of the conversation. Discernment is really critical, but pecking order is an equal part of the conversation and from an emotional standpoint, a larger part of the conversation because of the mistreatment and other problems that people that are highly competent often face, which we will of course continue to unpack throughout the video. Now one thing that I wanted to point out is that, you know, I've got a thing here that says that women have higher emotional intelligence than men globally. I do want to address this because this is a very contentious assertion, but when you look at studies globally speaking, women by and large score higher on emotional intelligence metrics than men. Some studies say that they are statistically insignificant, others find a large effect. So one thing is, one of the actually the first places that I heard this by and large or broadly speaking was Harvard Business Review. And of course Harvard is an Ivy League. So here I'm signaling saying look this information that I have comes from a trustworthy institution. It's not my assertion it's theirs. Right. So I'm offloading I'm delegating trust to an institution that has more credibility than I do. One thing is that Harvard has been talking about the superiority of women for many years now, at least 10 years. And they, of course, don't say it like women are better than men in all cases. But statistically speaking, female leaders tend to be better on certain metrics than men. In this case, employee engagement. If you report to a woman, you are more likely to feel engaged than if you report to a man. Now, that being said, there could be some selection bias here, right? Maybe people that choose to work for a woman make that choice for specific reasons. There's also the nature versus nurture argument. Is this an aspect of women biologically from having two X chromosomes? Or are they taught to be more empathetic and more emotionally intelligent? It's likely a bit of both, but what I will say is that this effect is found globally irrespective of culture and across time. So because women across time and space tend to have markedly higher emotional intelligence depending on how you measure it, that indicates that it is a biological feature which there's a very very good evolutionary reason for this which we're not going to get super lost in it but I did want to address this and that is that for a woman to measure a man's or you know mate's reliability requires more discernment. Tall poppy syndrome. This is the center most aspect of the most problematic and difficult feature of being outstanding, of being an exceptional person of talent or competence. So, tall poppy syndrome is defined quite simply as it's a social phenomenon where people of genuine merit are resented, attacked, cut down, or criticized because their talents or achievements elevate them above or distinguish them from their peers. So anyone who has gotten the best grades in the class or won the race or made the most money, if you're at the bottom of the rank or the top of the rank, you are a target for attack. And we'll unpack more of those group dynamics later in the video. But for now I want to just focus on tall poppy syndrome. So some people, and this goes for any kind of group like such as corporations, teams, so on, some people would prefer for the group to fail as long as they remain top dog. Remember the importance of pecking order. And so that means that they cannot, that some people cannot tolerate being second fiddle. They would rather eject someone who makes them feel insecure because if they feel like they're not the most competent person in the room, they would rather attack that person even if it harms the group in order to stay first fiddle, first chair. So this results in ostracism, bullying, and so on, particularly in toxic groups. Now all groups of humans are susceptible to this. Any outlier is likely to be attacked. any outlier is likely to be attacked. Now this tall poppy syndrome, the attack that happens against people, is often motivated by shame, insecurity, envy, or jealousy. So basically these interesting group dynamics can arise where if one person is seen as an outlier amongst the entire group, many people in the group might tacitly approve the bullying and ostracism of that person because that person is just too exceptional. And again, we'll talk about group dynamics in greater depth in a couple of slides. This is less likely to happen in groups that elevate and valorize excellence and competence, but not every group does that. For some groups, there is an implicit or tacit belief that, you know, we're going to do the best that we can, right? And you probably, as you're watching, you might be thinking, oh yeah, I was on that team once, you know, or it might be part of your family, actually. I've certainly, there are some segments of pretty much everyone's family who kind of tend to wallow in incompetence and valorize it because they know that they're not capable of more or better. And again, like that might sound very harsh, but like this is just an observation. So managing tall poppy syndrome is multifaceted, but the number one rule of thumb that I have is just avoid any group that does not possess a culture of excellence. Basically, make sure that you are working in a group or participating in a group, whether it's your friends, your family, your academic institution, your corporation, whatever. Make sure that you are in a group that truly, honestly, sincerely valorizes and elevates excellence and competence rather than just saying, oh yes, we strive for excellence because a lot of people say they do it but they don't actually do it because they dog pile on people who make them feel ashamed for not being as good as they thought they were. Another thing you can do is you can, and this paper just came out very recently but it also reminds me of a paper talking about just came out very recently, but it also reminds me of a paper talking about the most popular kids in school are often the kindest, and so there's this this kind of like weird inverted curve where as you go up the social hierarchy in like middle schools and high schools, social aggressiveness goes up until the very end where the most popular kids in school, the social nexus, are often the kindest, whereas the ones just a couple of fiddles down are actually the most aggressive because they're trying to establish their pecking order. And so that kindness is a pro-social behavior. Humility, right? Costly signaling, feigning ignorance for the sake of not making anyone else feel jealous and insecure. You mix that with agentic behavior. So agentic behavior is anything that demonstrates exceptionalism. Winning the track race, right? If you win the track race, you're not supposed to showboat and lord it over people. Everyone knows that you won, right? And other demonstrations of confidence can make people like you less now that being said when you are an extreme outlier feigning ignorance for that long is often not worth it and I'll talk more about that in various aspects as we go forward but basically when you have to constantly lower yourself just for the sake of fitting in. You will often sometimes kind of forget what you were truly capable of and sell yourself short or even become afraid to show people what you're truly capable of. So that's why I say that the number one strategy is make sure that you're in the correct group that elevates and supports that excellence knows excellence game recognizes game. So if you're not in the right group, the best thing you can do is just say, good riddance, get out, and find the right group for you. I've done this plenty of times. It's one of the best things. Like, don't force it. If it's not the right fit, don't force it. Just move on. That includes for all groups. Social groups, friend groups, professional groups, so on and so forth. Now, I've been talking a lot about pecking order. There is this thing called performative competence or performative intelligence. So, to read the definition, in competitive arenas, social signaling might be necessary. Because talent, intelligence, competence are all cryptic traits, you have to demonstrate your competence in those domains through proxies. So for example, in the academic realm, that can be through getting good grades. Good grades is associated with high intelligence. Also achieving accolades and honors. If you're invited to an honor society or you make Phi Beta Kappa or whatever, these are all seen as proxies for competence. And so this is why particularly in very competitive school situations, you'll have people really jockeying for, you know, valedictorian or whatever, right? Because that is saying I'm the top dog. In professional situations, in corporate situations, titles, promotions, commendations, right? Who knows who, who you get to go to lunch with, right? Which meetings you get invited to. These are all different indicators of competence. Now, I quit my corporate job about four or five months ago, maybe a little bit more now, and I got invited to any meeting that I wanted to because I had regularly demonstrated my high level of competence. When when people called Dave and Dave got involved things went well. That also painted a really gigantic target on my back which is why I'm never going to work a corporate job again. So in intellectual circles you might have book clubs or connections or you might want citations. So in this case, there's going to be people that if they're outside of academic or professional instances, such as stay-at-home parents, they might have to have other means of signaling their competence. And oftentimes, parents will try and signal their competence through their children. Their children are a reflection of their performance and so they might stake a lot of their identity to the quality and performance of their children saying, hey look my child's an honor roll student. That's why you see that sticker on the back of cars. My child's an honor roll student. That is signaling saying I'm a good parent because my child is doing good. Competitive clubs whether it's a sports club or anything else winning rank ranks any kind of thing that says that you're good right in the Internet sphere. Followers likes video counts watch counts whatever those all demonstrate clout which your clout your social clout is a proxy for your competence. And then finally conspicuous consumption which is why I picked this image here. So if you spend more money to have a nicer car to live in a nicer house to wear different clothes. These are ways of demonstrating that you have attained more wealth and more status as another signifier of competence. So remember that the perception of competence not confidence competence sorry if I'm saying it they sound pretty similar is often more important than true competence to many people. It's also expected that your level of competence will fit within the bounds or in-group stereotypes which we'll talk about more in just a moment. But in other words if you are in a group of people that have certain spoken or unspoken norms about how smart you're allowed to be to still be identified as an in-group member versus you're actually kind of weird, we're going to kick you out of the group or we're going to push you to the periphery of the group. So, as promised, in-group norms and violations. An in-group norm refers to the rules, or sorry, in-group norms refer to the rules, expectations, and standards that are developed within a particular group or community. These norms dictate how members of the group should behave in order to fit in and maintain membership. In-group norms can be explicit, meaning that they are formally stated or said aloud, or implicit, understood without being explicitly stated, implied through behavior, or other established patterns. They can pertain to anything from how members of the group dress, communicate, behave socially, or in the context of this video, demonstrate confidence. So to put it very simply, norms are a narrow window of acceptable behavior or characteristics or character traits. Norm violations result in criticism, dev devaluation ostracism or other consequences. So you know if you are in the popular kids but you dress in old ratty clothes then you're going to get teased for the clothes that you're wearing. If you're one of the smart kids and you don't know a fact that everyone else knows you might say aha you know Dave you're an idiot. Why don't you know that right. So there's different standards, there's different measurements that are used for norms in different groups. Now, punishing norm violations is a really, really fancy way of saying bullying. Punishing norm violations is indistinguishable from bullying in many cases, but the big difference is that it is often fully accepted within that group's context. So, for instance, if you want to run with the big dog, sometimes you might get bit. I think that's how they said it in Mean Girls. Anyways, if you're going to try and rub shoulders with the intellectual elite, you're going to get tested. They're going test your metal if you want to run with you know the popular kids they're going to you know establish how much you know about fashion or whatever it is that they care about I don't know look at me I'm wearing a 10 year old Google t-shirt I don't care about fashion. That is not a norm in the circles that I run with that we care about we care more about things that are comfortable because we're autistic. So anyways, punishing norm violations or even witnessing punishment, witnessing those social corrections is highly biochemically rewarding. You get a huge dopamine hit when you see someone just get punished for their norm violation, which is why a lot of stuff that ends up on the reddit front page is stuff like, you know, someone gets slapped down for, you know, harassing a target employee or whatever it happens to be, right? Because those norm violations where someone is harassing an innocent bystander and then gets their comeuppance, gets their justice, you know, street justice or whatever, that is very rewarding for everyone to see. It's like you got what you deserved, you had that coming, and that kind of outrage reaction is addictive because it is a dopamine fix. Now in the context of social groups, whether you are executing the punishment for the norm violation, teasing someone, or witnessing it, you get a biochemical reward. So that seems pretty cruel. Why would human societies evolve this way? And the idea is social cohesion and maintaining pecking order. That's why I say like, pecking order is incredibly important to social animals. And also you have to remember that our societies have gotten enormous relatively quickly, certainly far faster than evolution has had a chance to keep up, which is why we see teenagers being utterly ruthless to each other because that's kind of a more primal, primitive instinct when we were in small groups. But then over time, because of the flexibility of our prefrontal cortex they learn either to stop doing that because we all have met people that were really vicious in school and then you meet them years later and they're total sweethearts. There was one girl that I rode the bus with. She was in my neighborhood and she was I'm not going to use any mean words, but she was vicious. And she was in anime and Sailor Moon and all that stuff, and then I worked with her at the at the theater after high school, and she was a total sweetheart, and she's like, yeah, I probably wasn't that nice back then, you know, like some people grow up, but another thing that happens is many people do mellow out with age. This is probably the majority of people mellow out with age. Many people, though, they learn to get sneakier and more deceptive with their manipulation and controlling behavior, which we'll address in just a moment. Now, the flip side to all this, so we talked about performative competence. There is also something called strategic incompetence or feigning ignorance in order to dodge work, dodge responsibility, or also just avoid unwanted attention and confrontations with more dominant people. So strategic incompetence. Some people deploy this very, very deliberately in the workplace just so that they don't get more responsibilities dumped on them. This is one of the things that I experienced repeatedly in throughout my corporate career, which was. I just don't have the ability to implement strategic incompetence, so I ultimately get more and more work dumped on me and some people like, you know, I'm going to pretend like I don't know that or they'll kind of equivocate or whatever. Now that being said, men and women both employ this tactic. They do it consciously or unconsciously at home, in social groups, in workplaces, and so on. And sometimes I actually, I do employ strategic incompetence, but not in order to dodge work, but in order to give other people an opportunity to stretch themselves. This is actually something that they teach you as a manager is just because you can solve the problem for your employees, it might actually be good for to let them figure it out for themselves as a learning opportunity. So that's that is the one context where I can actually use strategic incompetence and still feel good about myself. Now that all that being said is that strategic incompetence is much more common for women, and at least in the past, and in some cultures and some places today, is explicitly coached. Women are explicitly coached to hide their abilities to avoid offending men. It's less common today, but it still happens all the time. And if it's not explicitly coached, it is implicitly kind of ingrained because many people will react poorly to a woman demonstrating competence. And so they learn just by virtue of having been punished or criticized or whatever to say like, oh, well, I don't really know. Again, there's plenty of idioms this where they might say like you might be cagey or you might play your cards close to the vest. Right. Again this is something that we kind of intuitively know but what I'm doing is I'm hanging a lampshade on and I'm pointing a spotlight at it. One thing that I will say is that in my personal opinion strategic incompetence when used systematically and regularly is detrimental in the long run. The reason is because you get so good at hiding your true self and your true ability, you learn to sell yourself short and you end up believing the lie. It can take a long time to unlearn that, which is really, really bad. So after doing that for many years of kind of like, you know, selling myself short, I decided to stop doing that. It alienated a lot of people. I had to leave my corporate jobs. Even my boss, when I told him I was like, I am bored out of my fucking skull here. He couldn't comprehend. He couldn't wrap his head around that because I was like, you have no idea how smart I actually am. I was like, I work 30 minutes a week and you guys are satisfied with me. This is a bullshit job. But of course, nobody likes to hear that because to them, they think like, oh, this is actually a really tough job and you're doing a great job. It's like, no, it's actually to me, trivial. And you know, if you tell someone that a job that they think is hard is trivial, it kind of offends them. Go figure. Anyways, definitely for me worth it to stop with the strategic incompetence for good. The reason that I added this bit about you end up believing the lie is because I had forgotten how much I suppressed my own abilities in the long run just for the sake of getting by. Another side to this coin, this is a many-sided coin, is imposter syndrome. So because of the jockeying for social pecking order, you might perceive yourself as a fraud because other people spend so much time strutting about and presenting their peacock feathers, collecting stamps as one of my friends calls it. And so other people do a lot of performative evidence, and this is very rampant on social media, where people signal how good they're doing and how successful they are, right? And because what they're doing is they're presenting a facade, and you know more about your life and your failures, you might say, oh, well, that person's doing infinitely better than me. Despite the evidence that you're actually, you might actually be doing really well. And so this is the cognitive dissonance called imposter syndrome, which results in a few things, persistent fear, which this is the performance pressure that I mentioned at the beginning of the video, which has to do with constant worry of being exposed. You're worried like, oh, they're going to find out one day that I'm actually not what I think that I am. And this is a social-based fear. This is a fear of losing your status, especially for those of us who grew up very smart, very gifted. Our status was pegged directly to our intellectual performance. So any threat to our performance was a huge risk. Whereas, like, if you're big and strong, then it's obvious that you're big and strong, and you don't really have to defend that. That being said, people still develop eating disorders and body dysmorphia, so I don't want to minimize that at all, right? Anything that you are measured on can become problematic or pathological. Another thing is perfectionism. So perfectionism for me manifested as workaholism. I needed to be the best at everything that I did and I needed to do it faster and cleaner and better in every way because, as I my identity and this is common for lots of gifted people my identity became pegged or staked on that performance which also goes to overworking or workaholism so that fear that perfectionism and that overworking that's all different sides of the same coin basically the causes are as numerous as everything that we've talked about so far ranging from unfair social treatment to family pressure. Family pressure is a really big one. Fortunately, my family took the opposite approach, where because my parents had had a lot of pressure put on them to succeed, they made a point to not put any pressure on me to succeed, but the rest of society did a good enough job that it didn't matter, right? Social competition in school, and then later on in the workplace, so on and so forth, there's a lot of forces conspiring to make gifted and talented and highly competent people feel insecure about it. Constant comparisons, for instance. Again, all of this comes down to there's two primary dynamics at work. One is pecking order and the other one is discernment. Both of these can come together to create imposter syndrome, particularly for bright people or talented or gifted people. Excuse me. Exploitation of competence. people. Excuse me. Exploitation of competence. So I alluded to this one at the very beginning and this is something that is it's probably later in the video because it's something that I've been coming to terms with this year as. So here's the story time. As I made a name for myself in artificial intelligence, I became more desirable. People started seeking me out for my advice and they wanted me to join their companies or join their startups or capture IP or whatever. All kinds of stuff. This is not a scientifically established pattern but this is kind of the best that I got. The first step is that people tend to dehumanize those that they perceive as talented or gifted or highly competent. And what that means is that when you dehumanize someone, you don't see them as a person anymore. You don't see them as deserving of boundaries, decency, or respect. You see them as an instrument, as a tool, or a means to an end. You can solve my problem. You can make me a lot of money. I cannot tell you the number of people that I have had to block and end calls with because it became very, very apparent that that was their primary attitude. And this is actually why I have a hard rule that I am not getting involved in any more corporations ever period. End of story. Entitlement is what comes next. Once you dehumanize someone once you see them as an object or a tool you feel like you can own that tool. You feel like you are entitled to use that tool for whatever means that you want. Hey you generate IP right or you generate solutions or you solve problems or whatever. And so when you have this combination of dehumanization and entitlement, this results in ignoring boundaries, rejecting boundaries, and anger when someone tries to establish those boundaries. The reason that I picked this image is because I've literally had people in my workplaces, this is when I still was in a corporation, literally just start screaming at me when I said, I can't do that right now because I'm about to burn out. And like, I don't know, it's weird. And so it's like, OK, just done with corporations, full stop. Because I thought that it would get better when I switched to startups and had a little bit more agency and authority. But it actually is worse because it's like, oh, well, you're the ideas guy. You're the artificial intelligence guy. So therefore you have to be there at every meeting to explain everything to everyone and everything rides on you. And I'm like, this is actually way worse. So another thing that drives that exploitation is envy and resentment and so in some cases and I have witnessed this firsthand is That some people will envy the attention that you get they will envy the things that you are capable of and they will resent you for it and so If they have emotional or personality disorders Their reaction to that is actually to desire to control that. So cluster B personality disorders, such as narcissism and borderline, are more about control. And so in those cases, if you're working with a narcissist or someone with narcissistic tendencies, and this is not the only disorder that can result in this, by the way. There's plenty of disorders out there. Some of them aren't even named. But those kinds of disorders, basically what happens is I perceive this person is better with me and I won't tolerate that shit. So I need to get control of them. Right. It's really that simple. And so then they dehumanize you. They become entitled to your time and attention. And then they also feel like you owe them something that you that they're entitled to your time and attention, and then they also feel like you owe them something, that they're entitled to extract value from you. Now in more, these last two things, lack of understanding and unrealistic expectations, these are the more innocent reasons for exploitation. In some cases, if you are so highly competent or talented that other people just don't get it, is if you are so highly competent or talented that other people just don't get it. I mean, there is, you know, there are plenty of people out there who just honestly do not understand what you are capable of and what you are not capable of. They don't understand that you have needs just like every other ordinary human. They kind of accidentally perceive you as superhuman and that leads to unrealistic expectations. But then again, anger is still a natural result when expectations are not met. And so even if someone innocently ended up with unrealistic expectations, they can still mistreat you because of that, and that can result in exploitation or feel like exploitation. So in pop culture, we have this really weird fascination with hyperintelligence. There are fictional characters all over the world that embody this. Sherlock Holmes, Tony Stark, Bruce Banner, Shuri, Khan, Doctor Strange, Doctor Who, and what I realized when I was making this list is that Benedict Cumberbatch often portrays lots of geniuses. One that I'll talk about in a moment is Alan Turing as well, so that's a real genius. There is, I forgot to add a slide for this, so I'm just going to wedge it in here, there are plenty of stories in mythology all over the world and a couple of tropes. So the wise man or wise woman trope is a mythic archetype where often the medicine man or the shaman of the village is not really allowed to participate in ordinary social life. They are relegated and expected to stay kind of in their place on the outskirts of the village or even outside of town. They're seen as a mythic or elevated figure that is not allowed to come to the Christmas party, but you go to them when you need something. And I have a story about this, where I have a member of my extended family that I would see at family functions every now and then, but had never called me, never given me a Christmas present or a birthday card or anything, you know, so a little bit more distant. But once I got my career started as a technology expert, then suddenly, you know, he would call me and be like, oh, I'm having a problem with my... I would just ignore him eventually. Everybody wants something. Another version of that is are thought of as highly competent. You know, because, well, you get the idea. So in the case of real geniuses or real historical figures who were seen as very highly competent, they often lead difficult lives. There's numerous reasons for this. Sometimes they are neurodivergent. You could probably make a really good case that both Alan Turing and Nikola Tesla were autistic or had sensory processing issues of some kind. They're elevated mythic, seen as superhuman, like I just said, but they're still human, just like you and me. They're also frequently misunderstood or mistreated. So in the case of Alan Turing, he helped crack Enigma during World War II, literally saved millions of lives, but was chemically castrated for being gay, and then that destroyed his quality of life to the point that he killed himself at age 41. Nikola Tesla, absolute prodigious genius where it came to electricity and electromagnetism, advance the science of radio. He died completely alone and broke and throughout his entire life he struggled with really profound sensory processing disorders, so profound to the fact, to the point that he thought that he was an alien. He was not sure that he was actually human because of how differently he perceived the world. And of course, today, we would be able to say, oh, you've got a combination of, you know, auditory processing disorder, tactile processing disorder, and probably a few other components to that. Rosalind Franklin, her work was taken by men or the credit for a lot of her work was taken. She died before she was given credit for the discovery of DNA. Again, very highly competent but because she was a woman, because she was more vulnerable, her work was taken. And this unfortunately still happens today. One of my best friends is a is a woman, a physicist. And she says, oh, yeah, oh, yeah. If you're not careful, like, someone will take credit for all of your work. And again, that goes back to the very beginning of the video where if if you can take credit for someone else's work, that will elevate you. And perception is reality in many cases. My last example is Katherine Johnson, a black woman at NASA. She was a prodigious mathematician. She helped with the Apollo moon landing and was not given credit until very recently. So again, highly competent people can often be exploited or mistreated or both. There is something that arose when I was working on this, and I realized that there is a strong correlation or relationship between privilege and competence. And so what I mean by that, obviously, if you come from a more privileged background, a wealthier family, they can pay for tutors. And so even if you're not the sharpest tool in the shed, through rigorous education, you can probably still do better than someone else. But there's other kinds of privileges, and this is by no means an exhaustive list of privileges. So one privilege is what's called pretty privilege. So pretty privilege is a colloquial way of referring to the fact that physically attractive people are perceived as more confident, more competent, and more trustworthy. So there has been this is one of the most robust psychological phenomenon. It is global and it applies to both men and women. And that is that if you are physically attractive, things are easier for you. Now that's not to say that your life is automatically easy, but there are certain things that are much easier for you if you are pretty. And one of those things is that you are perceived as more competent, regardless of whatever else you do. Very similar to that is height preference, particularly in men. Taller men are perceived as more competent. So one thing that I noticed, at one of the most dysfunctional organizations I ever worked at, most of the leaders were really tall men. And I was like, oh, I see what's happening here. These people are operating based on very, very basic social instinct, where they are jockeying for not actual competence but other signifiers that make them feel like they are surrounded by competent people. The same is also true of marketing teams legal teams and so on. One tech giant that I worked at across the campus there was you know I was in the technology side with all the other weirdo technology guys, but another building in the campus was full of the legal team, and the marketing team, and the business team. They were all very tall, in great shape. The marketing and legal building is where the gym was, put it that way. So they were tall, they were in good shape, they dressed really well, and they were very attractive. And so the reason that a company would do that is you pay for that additional feature because you put an attractive lawyer in a courtroom they're going to look like they have more power and competence than an overweight or unattractive lawyer. Like it's pretty it's pretty gross but that is how the world works. And some places do that deliberately some places don't do it deliberately. And it's also any tech any company of any corporation is not going to be monolithic. It will vary based on manager based on departments so on and so forth. A similar thing to all of this is what's called the halo effect which is that if you are exceptional at one thing it is presumed that you are exceptional at multiple things. So if you're a really good violinist, it might also assume that you're good with money or something, right? Which has been a somewhat interesting phenomenon because, as you probably know, I am well-spoken. I communicate verbally relatively effectively. There are certainly better orators out there, but I communicate pretty well and I know AI. And so then I end up with getting questions of all kinds of other things, which like, I am pretty smart, but like there's this weird phenomenon where it's like, I actually had to learn to tell people, like, I actually don't know. Cause they just kind of assumed that I knew everything. And I was like, okay, well, I feel like I need to demonstrate that I do. So I actually learned that actually saying, I don't know, is the easiest thing. I was like, I know a little bit about it, but it's outside of my wheelhouse. And people will respect that. I realized that it was just an unconscious assumption that people were making. It was not an actual strongly held expectation. It was just like, oh, Dave knows a lot about this. Let's see if he knows about this other thing. They didn't mean anything by it. Again, that goes back to that last slide about genuine misunderstanding. So there's lots and lots and lots of other kinds of signals of privilege, and I'm not going to continue to unpack them. Just these first three were sufficient, I think. So as we take a broader step back and look at the social and cultural dynamics, this is where I start to pick the salty quotes. So Isaac Asimov, prodigious writer, big big creature energy, likely on the spectrum or at least some kind of spectrum, likely on the spectrum, or at least some kind of spectrum, may be just prodigiously gifted. He wrote a lot. He read a lot. So I'm not going to say that I identify with him, but I get him. I feel like I understand him. He said, there is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.\" In particular, in America, we valorize and weaponize ignorance. And what I mean by that is that in some cases it is actually a matter of virtue signaling or signaling for group belonging to say oh well I don't know that I don't trust science right I don't read notebooks I don't trust science I trust my opinions and whatever talking head you know that I listen to on the news. This idea is actually reinforced by American education systems, which actually skip a few layers of Bloom's taxonomy, which we'll unpack in the next slide. But in other words, we start with kind of rote memorization and basic levels of understanding and then go immediately to the top of Bloom's taxonomy where it's like, okay, now you haven't skipped a few steps, but we're going to just say your opinion and your analysis is now valid because of that. And so we are trained from a very young age to have a very, very high level of confidence in our understanding and intuitions, which I'm not going to lie. I am absolutely guilty of that. I am an ugly American in that respect. And I believe that this is a deliberate thing because it tends to result in people that are overly confident in their abilities, which means many people are wrong, but some of them aren't. And if you have highly competent people that are also highly confident, they will achieve more, which goes to dynamics of American exceptionalism. But if you don't look at it that way then Americans also might look a little bit schizophrenic or hypocritical. And that's being very generous. So all right. I alluded to Bloom's taxonomy. Here's Bloom's taxonomy. So basically you start with rote memorization. You remember facts and figures. You start to make sure that you can understand or explain those ideas, then once the once you really comprehend something you can apply it, you can use it in new situations, then analysis, evaluation, and finally creation or synthesis of genuinely new information is at the high level. And so what we often do is that we, in American public schools, we start with memorization, we touch on understanding, and then we jump right to evaluation and synthesis, or evaluation and creation. So we don't make sure that you actually understand it, something well enough to apply or analyze it. And so this means that a lot of people are very confident in their own intuitions even though they don't really know how to support it. Again, I personally believe that some of this is is by design is so that American school systems will continue to churn out people that are a little bit too sure of themselves because, again, American exceptionalism is something that we tend to value implicitly or explicitly here in the States. Another aspect of this whole competence thing is the Dunning-Kruger effect. So in many cases, some people are highly confident in their ability to produce and synthesize valuable insights and intuitions just because they're at the very beginning of the Dunning-Kruger curve. And this was summarized quite succinctly by the fundamental cause, by this quotation, the fundamental cause of the trouble is that the modern world, or is that in the modern world, the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are often full of doubt Bertrand Russell, so Basically, he articulated the Dunning-Kruger effect before it was scientifically established This is not necessarily strictly an American thing and it's also Just a human thing right? You don't know what you don't know. If you know enough to say like oh this seems pretty simple and straightforward you might have a lot of confidence. Then you go into the insecure canyon of despair and you know another psychological effect because social standing is so important people might be really really really uncomfortable to admit that they don't know what they don't know or or to embrace ignorance which is why I said that one of the most important things for me was to learn to say I don't know that was one of the most liberating things especially as someone who is perceived as highly intelligent is like if you just if you get comfortable saying comfortable saying, I don't know, and that's okay, great. But there's a lot of insecurity around that and a lot of jockeying for social power or social position. True competence. This was a really great quotation that I found. Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target that no one else can see. Genius hits a target that no one else can see. Arthur Schopenhauer. So, from my perspective, one of the most frustrating things about being gifted, about being an outlier, is that I can see things that nobody else can see. And in my case, usually, within a year or two, there's evidence to support it. So for instance, I started writing my books about cognitive architecture about two years ago. Now cognitive architectures are all the rage. I was right. I was two years ahead. A lot of people are like, whatever, you know, when I came up with it. There's been plenty of other things, whether it's at workplaces or in social situations, where I made a very quick evaluation. I said this is what's happening and this is why and this is the solution, but then it took six months, 12 months, 18 months for other people to catch up to the fact and by then they're like, oh well you couldn't have known. There's no way you could have known that and that's a limitation of their imagination, of their capacity to recognize when someone else is that far ahead of them and so this is the saltiest quote of the video arguing with idiots is like playing chess with a pigeon no matter how good you are the bird is going to shit on the board and strut around like it won anyways this is these these quotes are do the best job at encapsulating the burden of competence that that I can and they hit a little bit more viscerally than the more clinical scientific approach that I've taken. There's a few other idioms and colloquialisms that I like that kind of help me stay grounded so one that comes from Texas and I love this one is Big Hat No Cattle. So Big Hat No Cattle is basically someone who invests in performative demonstrations of ability or status. But in this case, you have a big hat, a big 10-gallon hat, but you don't own any cows. So you don't actually have any substance to back it up. Very similar is Actions louder than words. So a lot of people talk a big game, but that doesn't mean that they actually know what they're doing. This is a much older one is don't trust the man selling the shirt off his back. Grifters and conmen will make really big promises. You know, you buy this, you'll be fine. You know, snake oil salesman. But when you look closely, they actually don't have that much to offer. This one, this next one actually comes from Tony Stark in the first Iron Man movie. No is a complete sentence. If someone does not take no for an answer, they're no good. If someone respects boundaries, that is a good sign. If someone does not respect boundaries, that is a really bad sign. And I ruthlessly eject those people from my life and my life is better for it. The next one is everyone wants something. In the context of this particular video, people perceive you as competent they almost always just want Your help or to exploit you or something along those lines. I know that's really super cynical but my now wife Put it put it best. She's like I don't need you. I want you in my life, right? So there's nothing that she needs from me intellectually, but she likes my company, right? And that's why we my life, right? So there's nothing that she needs from me intellectually But she likes my company right and that's why we got married, right? I always recommend people marry your best friend Because on an intellectual level there's nothing she needs from me. I think that's probably a better way of saying it There's very little that I can do for her that she cannot do for herself And we have different strengths and weaknesses, so in that respect we are equals. Here's another really salty quote from Mark Twain of all people. The more I learn about people, the more I like my dog. Which is true. I love my dog. He is dumb as a bag of hammers, but he is very, very sweet. And his needs are very uncomplicated. And this quotation actually didn't actually come from Albert Einstein, although he did express something similar. He said, you don't truly understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother. So this has been my personal kind of litmus test of competence. And that's actually why I'm so good at explaining things and labeling things is because this quotation, I learned it when I was 8 or 10 or 12 or something like that, and I was like, okay, well if Albert Einstein is the person that I'm constantly compared to, and he said this thing, this is a really great heuristic, and so I always aim for being able to explain things as simply and as clearly as possible. And then finally, trust but verify. Don't take anything at face value. Someone tells you that they've got the greatest solution, great. Remember, discernment. So there's been a lot of saltiness, a lot of stories about frustration and anger and exploitation and bullying and harassment and all kinds of stuff. So I wanted to end on a slightly more positive note. And this is a quotation from Pablo Picasso. The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away. And while I will always, of course, advocate guarding against exploitation, I will say that finding my gift, my systematic thinking, my gift for AI, whatever, whatever my gifts are, the more I give that away via YouTube and Patreon, the better things are. And so I wanted to end with this piece of advice because while it can be difficult, the burden of competence is a mixed bag, it's a mixed blessing, it's a double-edged sword. I will say that, at least right now, it feels like I'm moving in the right direction, especially as I recover from burnout. So thank you, I hope that you got a lot out of this video.
