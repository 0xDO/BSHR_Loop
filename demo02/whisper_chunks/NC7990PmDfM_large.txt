{"text": " Hey everybody, David Shapiro here for a video. So today we are going to do AutoMuse Blogger. So rather than generating long format fiction, we're going to generate blog posts. Now before we get started, I have to warn you that one, this use case, if you were to try and just do this and put it directly online, that is against OpenAI's policies. So don't do this. This is for research purposes only. Now that being said, you are allowed, as far as I know, you are allowed to use AI to generate content as long as you then put human eyes on it to edit it, clean it up, make sure that it's safe. And then also, I think part of the EULA requires that you say this was written by AI. I think. Obviously, check with OpenAI before going live on any apps that do this kind of thing. But that being said, lots and lots of folks have wanted blogs, and I've just had this churning in the back of my head, so we will take a stab at this. Now also, I posted a poll on YouTube and the results were overwhelming. Y'all want to have fewer videos, but higher quality videos. It was overwhelming. So stay tuned. This is going to be my first one where I'll do some editing after the fact, and we'll go from there because I've also got the chapters, right? I figured out how to automatically do chapters with GPT-3. All right, so, all that out of the way, let's get started. First, when I'm starting a project like this, what I've started doing is kind of brainstorming, getting my thoughts out, because then I have a template to follow. Oftentimes you see me rely on intuition, and intuition is good and it works much of the time but not always. Plus it's also not something that I can just tell you, like, use your intuition. So let's actually do a process. So what we're going to do is just brainstorm, okay, what do we think this is actually going to do is just brainstorm, okay, what do we think this is actually going to do? So, first, we're going to say take a prompt of some sort, natural language instructions like I want to blog about X. Brainstorm the structure of the request. If you just ask instruct series to write, it'll start writing. I mean, GPT-3, generative pre-trained model, it's generative. It will write. But one thing that it doesn't do is it doesn't necessarily think about structure. And so given whatever the input is, let's think about the best way to do it. So like, let's see, like maybe list a bunch of sections. And then what we can do is we can probably iterate on that list to improve it. Like is this a good list? list. Okay, so then once we have a list of sections, then we can say, okay, after we have the sections then do we just start writing or do we do some research? Probably we'll do some research. Let's see. Brainstorm some interesting, like some facts or points to include for each section. Yeah, and then let's see. And also we're gonna keep this in mind the whole time. So let's just bold that. Okay, so then we got some lists and points and then we actually want to write the thing. Okay, so then we'll write the actual sections, and then 6, iterate, improve the sections, and then done. And done. Okay, so that's where we'll start. actions, and then done. So that's where we'll start. I'm not going to dive into automatically pulling from external sources for this one. For this, we're going to start with something simple because GPT-3 already knows a lot, but perhaps in a future version or a different kind of thing, I might explore an automatic knowledge graph builder. Because that's something I've wanted to do anyways. But for the sake of this one, we're just going to assume that GPT-3 already has the information embedded in it somewhere. Because it's already read a lot of news in Reddit and Wikipedia and stuff. So the topic that I was going to do was going to be Shinto in Japan, because I'm reading a book about Japanese history and culture. So it's something that I happen to know a little bit about, and of course, GPT-3 has already read all of Wikipedia on all of these things, so I'm going to assume that it has enough knowledge to do this. So first thing we're going to do is we're going to go to the playground and we will say, so basically we're going to start with some prompt engineering. Let's see. Write a blog outline. Write a killer blog outline for the following request from a customer. Okay. Request. request I want a cool blog post about the history of Shinto and Horigate in Japan like I'm basically adopting the persona of like a surfer bro. Like, how did they come up with that idea? What does it mean? And let's see, and what are the coolest ones to see? I'm going to Japan next summer because I'm a weeb. Sorry. I have a bunch of friends who are, what is it, xenophile would be china. What do you call it if someone is like, an actual term if someone is obsessed with Japan? They're into anime and stuff. I used to be in high school. My high school girlfriend got me into anime and I was into it for like 10 years and then I kind of like got over it. I'm still a nerd. I'm not trying to defend that. Okay. Write a killer blog outline for the following request from a customer. Alright so the request is this. Okay so now brainstorm a list of sections for this blog post. Each section, let's see, let's see, the outline should meet the customers requests and each section should be, let's say, highly descriptive Provide a paragraph Explaining what should go Should go into each section Okay, so then we'll do sections and we'll start with one. So one thing that I do You'll notice often that I'll do all caps lock for for these things what that does It's very similar to what it does for humans. So for humans it draws your eye to it, where you're like, okay cool, this is like a thing that I need to pay attention to. But also it's a different set of tokens. It's represented differently inside of GPT-3, which allows it to kind of notice, oh this isn't just the word request, this is capital R request. Okay, so let's just let this run. Let's turn the token count up to a thousand. And then it starts writing. Okay, I don't want you to actually start writing it. So this isn't so good. writing it. So this isn't so good. I want to actually give me like, yeah, not just a table of contents, but like describe each section. So this is one thing that's really infuriating about the Instruct series is that if you can tell if it was trained to do something like what you're asking it to do, because it'll do it really well. But if it wasn't, it will just give you a table of contents and then start writing a thing. Yeah, actually. I wonder if I confused it. Let's see. All right. Let's see. Alright. Because, like, what is Shinto? There we go. How to incorporate Torgates into your Japan trip. That's not so bad. Okay, so I confused it when I said, like, add a paragraph, because then it's like, okay, let's write out all these things and then yeah. All right let's run this a couple times just to make sure that it's going to give me consistent behavior. The significance of Torogates, the different types of Torogates, the most famous Torogates in Japan. Okay I think we're off to a good start. So let's copy this as our first prompt. Okay so we'll do first prompt. OK, so we'll do request and then we'll do that. So this, we've got prompt. So this is going to be sections. So let's see, brainstorm the structure, take a list of a bunch of sections, iterate on that list to improve it. Is this a good list? Was I a good list? You were the best list. All right, so what I mean by this is lots of folks have started asking about having GPT-3 check itself to improve its own performance. And I find that it can work really well, not always. So let's just take a stab at this. Let's copy this whole prompt out based on the customer's request. brainstorm to see if there's any, there are any improvements I can make to this, I guess, outline, yeah, that's the word. I know words. Okay, so then we'll do, we'll copy the customer request and then we'll do outline and let's come back over here All right, and so then we'll do Brainstorm let's see, you know brainstorm some possible Improvements. All right. Let's see what it does Dad doesn't get it. Well maybe. It added a list. It added an item, how to visit Torii Gates. Oh, OK. Let's run that again, see if it gives us what is Shinto. Tips for seeing Torii Gates. So it did add a section. Alright. Hmm. I wonder what happens if we do this again. Again! Okay. Again, again, okay. What happens if we just regurgitate this? Shinto festivals associated with tour gates. Look at that. Okay, so if we run this so this I'm at the point in my career with GPT-3 where like if my intuition generates a prompt that behaves correctly the first time I don't trust it because I'm like wait a second hmm is this an accident so then we'll say outline but basically prompt improve outline and we'll change the sections to outline because for whatever reason my brain did not helpfully supply the word outline because that's where you start when you're writing anything, start an outline. Yeah, okay, so then we'll take, I keep leaning over because my microphone's a little bit in the way, so if the audio's a little bit worse I apologize, but I want to not be leaning over the whole video. Okay, let's just keep recycling this to see if it keeps improving. Frequently asked questions. I wonder if it's just gonna keep adding sections because this is actually doing a good job of like what can we do to add to this? So if it keeps going indefinitely, okay, so now what we have done is it has converged. So what we can do is we'll just keep rerunning this until we get convergence, which means that the input is the same as the output. Okay, so, yep, so that's good. And what am I doing? All right, so improve outline, let's see, keep it in editor, no, because I named it wrong. So we've got the outline and then we've got improve outline and that's good. Okay. Yes. I wonder, will it break if I give it a number one, that might prompt it to ensure that it will, oh, additional resources. So one thing that you can do is you can kind of give it a clue as to what you want it to look like. And so that's what you do here where I have this. This is just, it's a clue. It says give me a numbered list. Right? I don't have to tell it to give me a numbered list. I just give it a little tiny breadcrumb to say give me a numbered list. So I might do the same here just so that way, because sometimes you might end up with something where it's like, hey, I'm gonna come up with a completely new idea But if you tell it what you want implicitly or explicitly, so this is an implicit Request of the machine. So this might this might break it. We'll have to after we run it We might we might have to come back to this Okay, let's go here Okay request come back to this. Okay, let's go here. Request. All right, and then I think it's time to start coding actually. Because what I like to do is before I get too far, actually no, well, hmm. Let me take a look at the readme. How far do we want to go? So we've got the iteration. So we're already halfway done. Brainstorm some facts or points to include for each section. OK, so let's try this then. Let's try our hand at yada, yada, yada. I wish I hadn't closed those other ones. Ok, so given... Let's see, I have the following blog request to write I am focusing on Writing one section at a time Or let's see I need to brainstorm No, I need to jot down some notes about each section before I proceed. No, not each section, this section. This section before I proceed. Okay. Section. So then we'll just say, what is Shinto? And then we'll say, let's see. Here are my research notes on this section. I need to write everything I know about this. And let's see what it does. Let's see what it does. Here are my... Let's see what happens if we say detailed research notes. There we go. Much better. The Issei Grand Shrine. God of the Sun, God of Samatsuratsu. Okay. This is all in line with what I'm reading in my book. So it looks like it is... This is actually one that I'm not sure, haven't read about that in the book. But anyways, so it does look like it's being accurate. Although I wish this was a little bit more, I do, I like that it seemed like it produced a little bit more when it was a list. So let's see if we give it a clue. Yeah. Shinto is the largest with over 100 million followers, located in the city of Ise. First. And then if we do this again. See but this isn't everything that you know, right? Like I said, I asked for detailed research notes. I need to write everything I know and it gives me six bullet points. Really? Really? Okay, that's fine. But one thing that's interesting is it seems like, Shinto means the way of the gods, it almost seems like I can just run it a few times and it will give me different outputs each time. So maybe for this section we just run it a couple times. Actually this seems like it's working okay. Yeah. Yeah, okay. All right, so probably what we'll do is just break the sections down and then we will run this where we're asking for notes on each section. We'll run it a couple times to kind of get a little bit more out of it, out of the machine. That seems like it's working okay-ish. Okay, so then we'll do request and then we'll do request and then we'll do section and then we'll just leave this open ended so it might produce a paragraph, it might produce a list. Okay so we'll do prompt research, actually here we'll do section research. And so what this is doing, just to take a step back and tell you like, okay, what is this actually doing? So one misconception that people have is whether or not GPT-3 is pulling from a database or searching the internet or what, how is it doing all this? And so all this information is embedded in the neural network. And so what we're doing is we're writing a prompt to pull that information out of the neural network. And so this works in a similar fashion to how human brains work in that all of our knowledge and memories is implicit in the array of connections in our brain. And so with the right input, or the right, and sometimes the input can come from inside of our own brains, like if you're sitting there thinking, array of connections in our brain and so with the right input or the right and sometimes the input can come from inside of our own brains like if you're sitting there thinking like I need to think about everything I know about Japan you can kind of you know trace the dots you can connect the dots and get you know kind of pull out memories from your own brain and we're doing the same thing here we're we're breaking apart that that cognitive process of okay let me think through about everything that I know about this. And so that's what we're doing deliberately. Okay, so we got this section. Brainstorm some two or three X times. And so then what we'll do is, this is actually working better than I thought. Run it a couple times. Estimated 4 million followers. See, that's something where it's like 100 million and now there's 4 million. Like, okay. So we don't know if it's accurate, but this could also be a benefit of running it a few times. Yeah. Whoops. What just happened? How did I do that? Current editor. There we go. OK, so that's three iterations. Let's go for four. It seems like if you get four, we're first codified in the 8th century CE. According to the book I'm reading, that is not true. Japan didn't have written language until after the 4th century AD CE. So it couldn't have been codified. And it's saying 4 million again. So we will do fact checking in another video. Okay. Alright. I have compiled research notes. I have compiled the following research notes. I need to rewrite these notes into a long, professional blog post. It must be engaging blog post. And so basically all I'm going to do is take each of those sections, do some research, some internal brainstorming research, and then we'll generate a post on each of those sections. Now one thing that it will tend to do is it'll have these like little like sign offs right and it's like okay I don't want I don't want that but but we might have to deal with that okay anyways well probably can probably fix that at the end actually. So let's go ahead and just copy this out. Okay. So do research and And so this will be prompt, this will be section pros, so we're actually producing a final product at this point. Yeah, I think we're almost done. Because then we got the actual sections, iterate and improve. Ah, okay. So, yeah, I like that. So if we take this, we might need a second. Okay, yeah, yeah, this will actually work out well. I think I've got it all saved here, yeah, okay. So then we'll just copy this here. I wonder what will happen if I just say like, let's see, I need to rewrite the notes into a long professional blog post. It must be engaging. I have the first draft of the post. Now I need to improve on it. Okay, so then we'll say, first draft. Oh, hang on, my dog's barking. I gotta go see what he's barking at. Okay, sorry about that. All right, yes, so, first draft, and then we'll just add some new lines and do second draft. And you see, this is getting long, but one, we've broken it down into sections so we don't have to write the whole blog post at once and you see it's only a thousand tokens. So we're only at a quarter of our maximum. Okay. Look at this! Shinto beliefs and practices were first brought to Japan by Chinese immigrants? I don't know that that's accurate. But we see that this has gotten a little bit better. It's definitely integrating a little bit more of the information. Whether or not this information is factually accurate is different. So in a future version, probably what I'll do is show you how to integrate from a corpus of facts, of like other information, rather than just relying on confabulation and neural recall. So this, when you ask GPT-3 to just barf out a bunch of facts, that's called neural recall, and it can be pretty accurate, but it can also be crazy wrong. Okay, so let's see what happens if we just do this iteration a couple more times. So it's just... Whoops. Oh, it's just jumping down. Okay. It's actually making it shorter. Oh no. It clarified it a little bit. Okay. Okay, so this seems like it works okay. So let's add this as a... So we'll do section, second draft, and then we'll do this as research. Add a double new line there just to make it nice and consistent. And then we'll prompt, excuse me, prose. Actually do prompt improve pros. And then we'll just stitch it all together and that's all programmatic. Okay, fault temperature to seven, the tokens to 1000, because that's what we want. All right. Let's see. Well, first we need the topic. Okay, so topic equals open file, and we'll do topic.text. So I will save that here. So we'll save topic.text. There it is. All right, so we get the topic. And then the first thing we do is outline it. And then we improve the outline. Okay. I've got too many tabs open. Let me close some of these. Ah, no, don't close that one. Cancel, cancel. Abort. Okay. And then we'll say, let's see, outline equals... Yeah. Here, I'll just do this the messy way. I can work on cleaning it up and making it more efficient later. I have coffee and I'm not drinking it. What the heck is wrong with me? So now we're going to do build the outline. Prompt equals open file. So this was, see this is why I need to keep at least the prompts open. All right, so prompt outline and then it'll be prompt outline, and then section research, which we'll just run a few times. Prompt improve prose, okay, and then prose. Okay, cool. So the outline we only run once. So we'll do prompt outline.text, and then we'll do dot replace. Topic? Or no, I guess it was request. Yeah. So just to keep things consistent, we'll do request. Because the worst thing you can do for yourself is use multiple names for the same variable, it's very confusing. I do not recommend that. Alright, sorry, I'm having to lean away from my microphone again and it's making, it's throwing off my whole keyboard situation. As someone who writes, it's like there's this flow connection, and you can't hear it because I've got the like noise cancellation but I use a mechanical keyboard so you're welcome for that for you see the thing I use in video broadcast which is really helpful okay so we're replacing it request with the request that should be good and then And then we'll do outline equals, we'll do one plus, and we're gonna remove that. And then we'll do plus GPT-3 completion prompt. Okay, and then for debug, we'll just print the outline and we'll run this to make sure that it works. Python generate, whoops, CD, AutoMuse, Blogger, Python generate, request.txt, right, because I changed the file name in here but it didn't read my mind and changed the file name out here. OK, try that again. OK, cool. So that worked. That looks good. All right, so then what did I do? I did, see, this is why you write down what your plan is. Open the readme back up. Okay, so we got that. Iterate on the list. That's right, we did this about four times. Okay, so then we'll say for i in list range zero four, For i in list range 04, we are going to do outline equals improve outline. And then we'll pass it the request and the outline. And so basically this is the easiest way to do a recursive thing. So we'll do def improve outline and we're going to have the request and the outline passed in. And so then we're just going to use this prompt. So we say prompt equals open file prompt improve outline dot text. and so what you're seeing here, this is the most basic form of recursive programming with GPT-3 where you feed the same output into the same function several times so .replace request with request and then dot replace Outline with outline make sure that I use the right terminology. Yes outline is there brainstorm some possible improvements Okay, and then we'll copy the same Outline one dot and so the reason that you have to include this is same outline one dot. And so the reason that you have to include this is because the prompt already has that. See, if you don't have that, then the first one will not have its numbered list. And that just, it's bad form, and it doesn't look good. And then we'll do return outline. OK, so then we will, here, we'll... Actually, for debug purposes, I'll just leave all this. So do new line, new line, outline, and then we'll do improved outline. Okay, now let's test this real quick. Improved outline. Okay. Now let's test this real quick. What is Shinto? Tips for visiting. Facts. Okay, so it is reliably recreating what we wanted. And then it converged, and then it blew it up. Curse you! Okay. Yeah, it didn't, it just, it randomly nuked it. Okay, let's have fewer iterations, because if you do, if you try your luck, it will eventually break. The coolest Tori gates in Japan, different types of Tori gates. Okay, so doing one initial iteration and then three iterations seems to be good. Alright, so we'll leave it at that. Cool, so actually, it can be kind of fun to leave the debug output, so I'll probably just leave that there so that when you're running it you can see what it's doing. Okay, now we can tilt the scriptures, we got the good list, brainstorm some facts or points for each one. Yes, okay, so then section research. Yes, ok. So, sections equal outline dot split lines. So now the sections list we can iterate on this a few times. We're actually zeroing in on the final product. So let me think of how to do this. Because do we want to write it one section at a time? I think we do. Yeah, because the way that it breaks down now is we do the research on the section, we do the prose on the section, and then we stitch it all together, we improve the prose, and then we have the final product. Okay, so we'll do final blog equals, so we'll do that. Okay, so, four section in sections, so we're going to take each section and just write the whole thing. We might have a final step where we kind of like clean up the whole blog. Actually that's not a bad idea. Let me go ahead and add that note so I don't forget. Iterate through the sections and done. Lies. Let's see. Clean up the final product. Yes. Okay, so four section in sections. First is hashtag research. Sorry, I need to drink this coffee. Hashtag research. Ok. Yes. So we'll say research equals that. And then let's see, how many times did we do this? I think we did it like three or four times. So we'll do the same thing that we did here. So for i in list range, we'll say So, result equals research topic, actually no, here we'll call it neural recall because that's a more accurate thing as to what we're doing. So the neural recall is, yeah, so we need to pass the request in the section. Requests, section, and there will be some redundancy, but that's fine. That's why we added the seventh step to clean up the final product to just, let's rewrite the whole thing to be one nice consistent blog post. Okay. Um, okay. So, result equals neural recall. Def. Neural recall. This is like... This is the nerdier version of total recall. Uh, request. Extra points if, uh... Well, I guess they made a remake of that. Um, but the original total recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger came out when I was much younger I was alive when it came out. Some of my viewers are older than me, many of them are younger, so if you raise your hand, give me a thumbs up or a comment in the section in the comments below if you remember the original Total Recall okay, Neural Recall what is it that we're doing? This is basically just another prompt. Prompt equals open file prompt section research.txt and then we do .replace yes, what were the sections that I had in here? Request and section. Right. These two. Ah! See, that is where you do yourself a favor if you have variables that are very simple and straightforward and make sense. And then place section with section. Okay. And then we do, let's see, notes equal GPT-3 completion prompt, and then return notes. And I know what some of you are thinking, you're thinking, oh, you can just do return this. There's nothing wrong with that, but I got out of the habit of doing that because every now and then you'll want to do some little post-processing like nodes equals nodes.replace that with that, depending on the kind of format you're looking for. So I just got out of the habit of returning the function result directly and capturing the results in a variable and then passing the variable back. It's either or, you can do whatever you want. It saves you a line of code, but a line of code, who cares let's see, that's going to have no new line, so we'll do plus new line, dollar s, and then we'll do dollar result. Yes, okay, so the research will be done, so research equals research.strip, which that will remove any superfluous white space from the ends. So now we've got the research. Yes, so we'll run the research a couple times. We've done the research, and then we take the research and write the blog post. Okay, so do first draft. Draft, not draft five. Okay, this should be as straightforward as prompt equals prompt section, no. What am I doing? Good grief. Open file. Prompt section pros.txt and do replace research with research. So this is, there's a couple things happening here. So there's prompt chaining, which is where you've got prompt, prompt, prompt, prompt, prompt. So that's prompt chaining, but then we're also doing iterative loops, so we're doing recursive loops inside of the prompt chain. So this is pretty advanced. But this is just the same process that a human goes through when writing a thing. You brainstorm the structure, you gather all the facts, then you write the pros, and then you iterate on the pros and make it better. Now I need to improve on it. I wonder if it would be good if we gave it some descriptions like we need to make it more engaging, but whatever. Okay. Prompt, open file. Okay, and so then we'll say prose equals GPT-3 completion. Prompt. There you have it. All right, so that's our first edition of the prose. And then we do the same thing here where we attach the research and the pros. This should actually probably, we'll change this to pros, keep it nice and consistent. And I think we did it what, like two or three times before it started kind of going off the rails. So we'll do just two improvements of improving the pros. So pros equals improve pros. And so what did I have in here? We have the research and the pros. Research and pros. So we just improve itself. So recursive programming for kiddies who don't know, you could not do this where you pass a variable, where you assign a variable and pass it at the same time. This is a newer thing. Back in the days of Pascal and C++, you would have to declare something like pros2 equals pros, and then you'd say pros equals pros2. It's silly. But now you don't have to do that anymore. Now you can just call it directly and it's just a single step. Okay, so the improved pros is going to be the same as improve outline with mild difference. So we'll do improve pros, and instead of request an outline, it's research and pros. So we'll do improve pros, research, oops, uppercase and pros, oops, gotta replace both, lowercase and then pros, uppercase. And then we don't need that. And so then we also change the name back to pros and pros. Okay, so then we call improve pros, we just call it a handful of times and we end up with a better set of pros. And actually what we'll do is we'll declare the final blog as a list and so then we'll do final blog dot append prose. So that'll be a list of sections that we can then, we can keep them separate so that we can give them headers and also we can continue to improve them separately if we want. Are we done? Hold on. This is what happens to me. I get so focused on what I'm doing that it's just like, wait, that's the end, right? I know there is one last thing, but I wanna see how this looks before we do the final step, which is this one, clean up the final product. Okay, so let's give some whoops. Let's come back here. Let's get some output as we go. So we'll print. New line new line research. Yeah, so we'll do, first we'll print new line, new line, section, section, use that variable, right? Yep. So then we do the section and then we do research because we need something to look at while we're doing this. And we'll do print new line, new line, prose, and then we'll just copy this down here and then it'll be appended. And so then finally, here at the end of all things, we will just do, here, we'll do from pprint import pprint, so this is pretty print, so we'll do pretty print final blog, and this is just for debug. Okay, so let's, I need to zoom out a little bit, because this is enormous. Well no, let's see how it looks. Okay, generate a blog, end to end. History of Shinto. Improved outline. Predictions for the future of the religion, that's cool. Heck yeah. And then, oh wow. That got real long, so we're gonna have 10 sections. Do, do, do, do, do, do. We'll probably like accelerate this. Oops, it crashed. Reserque is not defined. What do you mean I did a typo? Let's see, this is line 87. Huh, oops. Right here. Dang, so close. But this is why you test your code. All right, let's do this again. All right, I am gonna make it a little smaller because this is outputting quite a bit. So we'll go down to 24. There. How to build a Tori gate. There we go. Oh, we've got... Yeah, we've got the double newlines. So for the final outline, outline equals outline dot replace and we'll do double new line with just single new line because we're gonna end up with yeah okay but this is this is this is alright so far so good Cool, cool, cool. And then the section has nothing. Yeah, darn it. Darn it! And it puts out nothing. We'll just let it finish and see what happens. There are about 80, about Shinto. Okay, cool. So this is going to iterate through each of these sections for a little while. I'm going to go ahead and pause the video and we'll see because you get the idea. We don't need to read this. So we and pause the video and we'll see, because you get the idea. We don't need to read this. So, we'll pause the video, we'll come back once it's done. It worked, mostly. It produced a lot of content, I'll put it that way. Now unfortunately, this was just a test run, so we've got all this, so let's just get all this out to a text file. So I added this while we were waiting where it'll actually save it out to file because I should have done that. And I'll probably separate out so that we'll clean up the blog afterwards. But first, let's just see what we've got. So let's do a find and replace the single quotes with nothing, replace all, and then we'll replace backslash, backslash, and with nothing. Actually, no, this will be normal find and replace. So that cleans that up. Yeah, there we go. Okay. Normal find and replace. So that cleans that up. Yeah, there we go. Um, okay. That is, yeah, there's a lot. I'm not going to read the whole thing. But we've got, it's 21,000 characters long. Um, so clearly this is like, yeah. This is quite a bit. Um, I think what I'm going to do, because that's, well how many tokens is this? Let's plug this into, 5,000 tokens. So we want it to be maybe half that, maybe not quite as long. So what we'll do is we'll do just a little bit less research and a little bit less brainstorming. So hopefully that will make it a little bit more reasonable because what I'd like to be able to do is to do the final cleanup in one window and we can't do that right now. Okay, so we've got this. I've got it so that it'll save it out to file. I wish that I had done this the first time, but what we're gonna do is we're going to choose an entirely different topic because I tested it on one topic. So I want a blog post about the history of the printing press. I'd like to know how it influenced religion, politics, and war throughout history and up through the modern age. So I'm going to go ahead and kick this off, generate blog, and then we'll come back with a brand new blog and then we'll get into the process of improving a blog automatically. Why is it doing nothing? Did it not do any research? Oh, there it is, okay. There we go. Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and pause it and we'll come back in just a second. Okay, we have a blog post about the printing press. And I think I actually lied, I think I'm going to call it here because this is actually not bad. And doing, improving an existing document is worth its own project. So I think what's going to come after this is I'll have one video or a project about pulling from external sources like how to search and automatically compile sources because that has applications all over the place such as automated research for like academia not just writing blogs and then automatically improving stuff at basically being an editor is a whole other function. So we will call this a day. Get status, get add, get commit am all done, and get push. So yeah, so there's a blog post out here. It is now 10,000 characters long, which means that it should fit into a single window. So you could, in theory, ask GPT-3, hey, take this blog post and rewrite it if you want to. I'm not going to worry about it, because yeah, this video is already plenty long, and you now have an end-to-end process of prompt chaining and recursive prompting in order to generate, be very generative and make something better. Remember, use this responsibly. I am not responsible if you use this to do something unethical. Yeah, this is on you.
