{"text": " Oh my god. But there's a more important reason that I would stop doing comedy right now. And this reason is the real reason that's been percolating and it really is the crowd, not you. I'm talking about the crowd on the big stage. It's too hard to entertain a country whose ears are so brittle. Motherfuckers are so sensitive, the whole country has turned into bitch ass niggas. Yes! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Everything you say upsets somebody. You know, I can remember when it all started. It was when I was doing Chappelle's Show. When I was doing Chappelle's Show, I used to do the show and then on the weekends, I'd do like concerts and shit like that. So I'm doing a concert and there was a couple in the front row. Beautiful couple. The wife, wife was obviously Asian. You could see it in her face. The husband, this motherfucker was mysterious, to say the least. Couldn't quite pinpoint where he was from. Caramel colored fella, very nice hair, but he could have been from anywhere. Bangladesh, Mexico, I can't guess with a nigga like this. All I knew for sure about this guy is that his wife was a bitch. I could see that in her face too. No, he was laughing and having a good time and she was scowling at me at a goddamn comedy show. I couldn't figure it out. And then I realized at some point that she was pregnant and I was smoking on stage. I said, oh my God, that's probably why she's mad. So I started to put my cigarette out, but then she hit me with one of them fake non-smoker calls. Kek, kek, kek. So I just kept smoking. I thought to myself, bitch, that babe will be fine, relax. And I tried to break the tension. I just asked her, that's all I said. I go, hey, where are you guys from anyway? And I could tell that she was on to me. She goes, very condescendingly she says I'm from California if you're asking my ethnicity I am Chinese and her husband was just cool about the shit he was like I'm Mexican bro I said well I'm sorry if I offended you by asking, but you're a very beautiful couple, and, miss, there's no question that you're gonna give birth to the hardest-working baby this world has ever seen. That's not a bad joke. She got very upset. She got up to leave immediately, but she didn't just leave. She had to take one last dig at me on the way out. I will never buy one of these things. She got very upset. She got up to leave immediately, but she didn't just leave, she had to take one last dig at me on the way out. I will never buy one of your fucking DVDs again, Dave Chappelle. I said, ma'am, with all due respect, Chinese people don't buy DVDs. these. And the crowd went crazy. We were all laughing, having a good time. I didn't even think anything of it. And then just three days later, this lady sends a fucking letter to my promoter telling him not to book me for shows anymore because I was quote racist, huh, and, and I'm quoting her, insensitive to the nature of my interracial marriage. I was like, word bitch, I was. If she had just done a little bit of research, she would know that I myself am in an interracial marriage. That's right. In fact, my wife is Asian too. Surprise, bitch, I'll see you on Thanksgiving. But my wife's not Chinese. She's Filipino. That's right, that's right. And our kids are Puerto Rican somehow, so there you go. I don't give a fuck about interracial marriage. In fact, you know what? My mother is half white. A lot of people don't know that. Well, all right, you were a little too excited, but okay. A lot of people don't believe me when I say that, but it's true. You can't tell looking at me, but if I grew my hair out, you would think you was at a fucking Cat Williams concert. My shit is beautiful. But motherfuckers are just taking it too far I don't know why or how everybody got this goddamn sensitive. You know who hates me the most? The transgender community. Wow I mean it is really bad out here isn't it? Kevin Spacey's out here grabbing men by the pussy. I didn't even know that was possible. Jesus Christ. He got the guy from Star Trek, the Next Generation. That's who we got. Last time, he didn't sound like he was more than that, but that's who set it off. He's 14 years old, and Kevin Spacey, costume at a party, which I gotta say, by the way, for the record, been to a lot of parties in my day. Never been to a good one that had 14 year old boys in it. Not even when I was 13, you know what I mean? Who wants a kid with a bunch of Hufflepuff-a-chewing niggas like, I'm having a good time, nigga. Yuck. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. And not the victim blame, but it seems like the kind of situation that a gay 14 year old would get himself into. I know I didn't say that right, but it's true nigga. You know why I say that though? Because I went to an arts high school and like, oh, them niggas was gay, man. Like in high school, all them dudes was gay. And them gay dudes dudes way more mature than the rest of us and we didn't know why we just knew they was mature you see gay dude at lunch perfect posh eating responsibly take that thermos down. He'd be like, what the fuck is that? Is this nigga drinking wine with lunch? Laughter We didn't know what it was. Because we were young boys, we were just trying to figure out who we were. And we didn't realize these gay dudes was fighting to be who they knew they already were. Some impressive shit. They were fearless to gay kids. Fucking fearless. I've never seen a scared gay dude in my life. What kind of man has no fear? You'd be tied up in a hostage situation with a gay dude. Them niggas would still be like, I'm thirsty. Psh. Psh. Psh. Psh. Psh. Psh.h. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. I'm thirsty, David. I need something to drink. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. Pshh. Well, then shoot me. Pshh. Pshh. I would rather die of a bullet than dehydration, nigga. I am thirsty. I need some water. All jokes aside, Kevin Spacey shouldn't have done that shit to that kid. He's 14 years old and was forced to carry a grown man's secret for 30 years. Jesus Christ, he must have been busting at the seams with that one. The saddest part is, if he were able to carry that secret for six more months, I would get to know how House of Cards ends.
