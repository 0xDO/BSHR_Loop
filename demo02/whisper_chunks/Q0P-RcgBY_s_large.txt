{"text": " Hello everybody, David Shapiro here with another video on my life channel. So today's video is about a topic that I have named myself. There's probably a formal scientific, you know, psychology term for this, but I couldn't find it. But it definitely needs a name, and I call it perception mediated empathy deficit. And so the one of the most famous examples of this is when you look at someone and say oh you're so pretty you must have it so easy. So let's unpack this. This is the definition that I was able to hack out with the help of chat GPT. So perception mediated empathy deficit is a cognitive bias that leads to a decreased capacity for empathy towards individuals perceived as advantaged due to certain attributes such as beauty, intelligence, or success. It's characterized by a subjective biased perception that often overlooks or diminishes the challenges faced by those seen as advantaged, leading to stereotyping and prejudice. PMED, which can vary in intensity and is influenced by social, cultural, and individual contexts, often serves as a psychological defense mechanism to justify a lack of understanding or empathy. In other words, it involves othering someone that you cannot identify with. So here's some other characteristics of PMED or perception-mediated empathy deficit. So first of all, it is perception is perception based meaning that it is inherently subjective and it has to do with how how someone subjectively perceive someone regardless of what is actually true. If someone perceives you as advantaged it doesn't actually matter whether or not you're actually advantaged. For instance I had former friends who perceived me as substantially advantaged. For instance, I had former friends who perceived me as substantially advantaged just because I owned my own house and they resented me for that because they did not own their own house. Another thing is empathy deficit. So the empathy deficit is a reduced capacity or willingness to express empathy for people they perceive as having certain attributes or advantages. And so in the case of where I talked about former friends, that they were acted very entitled towards me just because I owned a house and said like, oh, well, you're a member of the capitalist class. They literally said that you're a member of the capitalist class because I owned a house. And therefore, I was kind of lumped in with a group that they were able to justify as having absolutely no empathy for. It is a bias in perception so it is inherently about that kind of prejudice where it's like I'm going to other you or group you with someone that does not actually deserve empathy in some cases. It has to do with stereotyping. In this example where I was lumped in with Bill Gates, a billionaire, it's like I own a suburban house, right? It's not I'm not a landlord. I'm not the king of England who's about to evict you from your your hair inherited farm or something like that It's also a defense mechanism because some people might feel insecure or envious or whatever it can be it's also variable intensity and Which case it is it can range and to anything from just mild resentment to outright hostility or a little bit or even just cause a little bit of friction or a little tiny bit of jealousy and it's also contextual. One thing that I've noticed about this phenomenon is that it varies drastically depending on the social milieu in which it is taking place. So for instance you might have someone who looks at a celebrity and you say about that celebrity, oh, they must have it so easy. But then that celebrity talks to another celebrity and then they can commiserate on the shared challenges that they face. And at the core, it actually has a lot to do with not being able to understand the experiences of someone else. Like I said in the in the definition has it has to do with othering someone just because you cannot identify with them. So I want to pick a few examples now keep in mind that these are all extreme examples but in the example that I shared at the beginning where I had a set of friends that they just resented me because they were my age but they hadn't managed to buy their own house which is like that's a really common thing. You can get the same kind of thing in workplaces in within families or even just in your own neighborhood. Right. So any any signifier of advantage is often a something that can be targeted for attack. But by using celebrities and other examples in the coming slides, I hope to more fully elucidate this phenomenon and show that it is actually a very systematic response and it's a deeply seated psychological response. And then after that, I will also share some reasons that it is, I'm not going to say justified but the reasons that it's there. OK. So in case of celebrities you might say or you might hear someone say you know what do they have to be depressed about. They're rich and famous. Well there's a few things that they might be depressed about which is intense public scrutiny invasion of of privacy, pressure to maintain a public image, exploitation by industry professionals, higher risk for substance abuse and mental health issues. They're expected to absorb abuse, just kind of smile and nod. And they're also expected to hide their real struggles. Case in point being Robin Williams. If you're not familiar, he struggled with, I think it was either bipolar depression or major depressive disorder, but also near the end of his life, he struggled with dementia, very, very severe dementia. And so importantly, whatever you perceive a celebrity as being, they're still human, just like you. Another example, and this is how the conversation started is the intellectually gifted and this is there is a bull there's a very pervasive belief within society within the medical establishment and with an education that if you're gifted you don't need any help you'll figure it out for yourself and this mentality is actually so pervasive that even a lot of gifted people end up internalizing it and I certainly did for a while Now some of the downsides of being gifted certainly there are some upsides of being gifted We are we tend to be better at solving some kinds of problems that being said it is a mixed blessing So it can come with social isolation due to being different if people can't't identify with the way that you think, they are going to other you. That's just the fact of life that I have discovered. Pressure to succeed. More often than not, if you're gifted or talented, your reputation or identity becomes staked on your intellectual superiority or whatever people perceive it to be. Heightened sensitivity and emotional intensity. This has to do with on your intellectual superiority or whatever people perceive it to be. Heightened sensitivity and emotional intensity. This is very common with gifted people or HSP people, where we actually have a more sensitive constitution when it comes to empathy. We actually tend to be overly empathetic. We feel the feelings of people and the judgments of people far more acutely than neurotypical people. Another pressure is asynchronous develop. We tend to be precocious, meaning that we learn to read and speak and think at a level far higher than our peers. My wife and I both had this where we were reading college-level books by the time we were in middle school, and of course that is another thing that sets us apart from our peers when we were little and believe me that trend continues because I am still reading at a level far higher than most of my peers existential dread. I was actually kind of funny when I saw that this this popped up but it's actually very true is that the more gifted you are the more you are able to perceive the problems in the world and the more gifted you are, the more you are able to perceive the problems in the world and the problems facing you. And it leads you to very deeply contemplate things like death and existential risks and extinction of the human race and that sort of stuff. I laugh, but it's actually a thing that many people that are gifted struggle with, and some of them don't get out of it. Bullying due to differences, I already alluded to that. But also the expectation to figure stuff out for yourself. Doctors, educators, and even family members will often refuse to help you if they figure out that you're smarter than them. And I don't fully understand this phenomenon, but it is definitely true, and it has happened to me many times in my life. More often than not I end up having to do a lot of my own medical research because if I go to the doctor's office and you know say like I've done this, this, and this and I discovered this, this, and this and like I'm trying, what I'm trying to do is get the best medical care possible. It happens, it works sometimes but depending on the demographic let's say of the, I am likely to just say, get a response like, oh yeah, that sounds right, and then they kind of shoo you out of the door. So yes, many gifted people are kind of expected to figure things out for themselves. And again, this mentality is often kind of enforced on us. Attractiveness. So this is where I open, you know, you're so pretty, you must have it so easy. Yeah. So certainly if someone is attractive, there are some things that are easier to them, but it as with any advantage, it also is a double edged sword. It's a mixed blessing. Attractiveness often also comes with objectification and being targeted for exploitation. If you're attractive you're at a much higher risk of harassment and sexual abuse, which the PTSD and trauma that comes from sexual abuse can be not just life-changing but life-destroying, and that is not something that people should take lightly. Pressure to maintain physical appearance. This is often what that people should take lightly. Pressure to maintain physical appearance. This is often what drives people to develop body dysmorphia and eating disorders. Being valued primary for your looks rather than your talent or intellect, or even for being human. In many cases, people, the level of objectification gets to the point where some people explicitly don't even want to think of the person as a human. They want to think of them as an object or a tool or something that they're entitled to. And an extension of that is not being taken seriously for anything else, which is why I picked an image of Emily Ratajkowski. I'm thinking I'm saying her name right. Anyways, she's a very pretty face, but she's also pretty talented in other ways, and she has struggled a lot to break that mold of just being a model. And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, higher risk of suicide and eating disorders, amongst other things. Yeah, so again, like yes, being attractive certainly has its advantages, but it also absolutely comes with disadvantages. Successful entrepreneurs. You've made so much money. They have nothing to complain about right? What is what are they complaining about? However, being successful does come with its own downsides such as being subject subjected to intense public criticism and skepticism being misunderstood and misrepresented. You know, Bill Gates was on the TED stage a few years ago warning about COVID. And then what happens when we have a COVID epidemic people say, oh, he must have started it. Right? Like it's just like, oh my God. Okay, fine, whatever. Again, increased scrutiny in terms of legal, financial, and social scrutiny. Also, once you achieve a certain level of success, everyone wants something, usually money. When I was younger, I was a little bit more successful than some of my friends, and I had a friend kind of call me up out of the blue that I had been friends with in high school and he wanted to hang out, but the only reason that he wanted to hang out was to ask me to cover rent for him. And I said, no, you need to solve this problem for yourself. I solved it for myself and we had more or less the same background. Uh, then another thing is loneliness due to mistrust and manipulation. There's a show, I think it's called succession. Um, I think it's on HBO. I haven't seen it, but I saw a video about it. But anyways, the patriarch of the family talks about how everyone is a shark and, you know, because he's got this huge fortune, the only thing people want from him is, is money, including his own family. And apparently that is actually a very, very true thing that happens. And a lot of people kind of become victims of their own success where people don't see them as humans anymore, they just see them as a bank account. And certainly with my expertise in AI, I have had people look at me and see only dollar signs. And I'm not even that, you know, I'm not a global figure in AI. So that's definitely a thing. And then also, if you're very successful, you get targeted by frivolous lawsuits and other forms of exploitation. I Think it was Sergey Brin of Google said that success breeds litigation So yeah Definitely some downsides there for being successful as an entrepreneur And then finally privileged families such as the Royal Family of England, which of course I am NOT going to defend the Royal Family of England as an institution But what I will say is that you know that mentality of oh, well, they've never had to work a day in their life That being said they do come under intense pressure to uphold their family values The expectations placed on them and the standards that society places on them. They're not allowed to be real humans. They have to be aloof and apart and difference. Another thing that can happen in many privileged families, and I don't mean just the royal family of England, but pretty much any privileged family, is that love or acceptance may be conditioned or withheld depending upon markers of success or conformance to those standards. And so what I mean by that is that I've had the experience of interacting with people either from privileged families or people that have that have interacted with privileged families. And, oh boy, privileged families can be some of the most not saying that they all are, but they can be very, very deeply disordered where they are so uncomfortable with expressions of affection or attachment that it is all conditioned upon grade, success, you know, other markers of attaining and maintaining that level of privilege. And perception, managing perception of the family often becomes more important than the genuine and authentic needs of the individual members of that family. And basically the pressure to prove oneself. And in the case of King Charles here, he was not allowed to marry the woman that he loved for many years due to court intrigue and all that stuff. So heavy lies the crown. And again, I'm not saying that the royal family is not deserving of scrutiny, and we'll actually talk about that in just a moment. So to play devil's advocate against my own position about perception-mediated empathy deficit, the first topic is choice. In many cases, some of these things are deliberate choices. For instance, no one is accidentally an entrepreneur, right? Elon Musk did not accidentally become a billionaire, and so should he be held accountable for his decisions and actions? Absolutely. He chose this path, and he could opt out at any time. He could give away his money. He could step down. He could do a number of things. Perfect example from the royal family, Prince Harry left. He didn't like how he was being treated, so he left. So he sacrificed his privileged family for a more ordinary life. That being said, I do want to point out that some things are not a choice. Emily Ratajkowski did not choose to be born with her face and her body. I did not choose to be born autistic and gifted. So I do want to point out that in some cases choice is involved, but in other cases it is not involved. And another point of contention about these things is responsibility. And so this has to do with the accumulation and use of power, whether that power is earned or unearned, and the misuse of that power and the social responsibility that comes with some of it. So in the cases of people that accumulate celebrity status or money or influence or anything like that, there is a social contract involved in this and so violations of that social contract are often heavily punished, which is why I picked Bernie Madoff because he made billions of dollars and hurt a bunch of people. Granted, most of the people that he hurt were on the wealthier side, so you could argue, okay, well maybe they had it coming, but the point is is that you don't know his circumstances nor the circumstances of the people that he hurt, but what we do know is that he violated that social contract. And so the social contract of the power that we give people, whether they're celebrities or entrepreneurs or just attractive, that is often what people are responding to when they say, that person doesn't deserve my empathy anymore. So what I will say is remember the human. Everyone is struggling with something that you know nothing about. Everyone has their own battles. Everyone has their own demons. It does not matter how wealthy or powerful or successful you think they are, they are still a human. And so what I will recommend is that if you err on the side of empathy and caution, you will never regret it. You know, there have been certainly times in my life where I made a snap judgment about someone and I was proved wrong. Shared experiences also increase empathy. As I am in the middle of a transition in my own life, kind of building a social media presence. I am beginning to understand people that I used to criticize more and I get it now. And so I am equally guilty of PMED as anyone else, which is why I'm making this video is because self-awareness, but also I'm starting this video is because self-awareness but also I'm starting to experience the other side. Maintaining good boundaries and respecting people's boundaries is also really critical for this and the reason that I picked Nikola Tesla here is because Nikola Tesla in his journals described what we would know today as profound sensory processing disorder. So if he became overstimulated, such as like going out for a walk on a nice clear brisk morning, he would often end up with a migraine for the rest of the day. But of course, we didn't have the neuroscience to demonstrate that. And so he thought that he was deeply sick or maybe cursed or perhaps even not human. And so I have a tremendous amount of empathy for someone like Nikola Tesla because he was very gifted and very different. Fortunately, my sensory processing disorders are not nearly as profound as his, but I can still identify with that and say, yes, that really sucks. And I understand that feeling of being alien or different especially because until I knew that I was autistic and that I had some of these other differences these neuro neurological differences I had no idea what was wrong with me. And now that I do it's like oh OK I'm not alone. Now if you are on the side of having a lack of empathy shown towards you here's a few Guidelines that I could say that I are pretty common So first boundaries good boundaries are critical to avoiding being exploited and also for rejecting unfair treatment It may be necessary to block or remove certain people or groups from your life, especially if they do not respect boundaries. So in this case, you know, as people identify me as someone of potential value, I am very I am much more discerning about, you know, who I even allow to connect with me on LinkedIn, for instance, because a lot of people will try and sell me something. A lot of people will try and rope me into their schemes, uh, that sort of thing. And so I'm much more discerning about that. And if I tell someone no and they become persistent, um, that is actually one of the biggest red flags. Uh, and so I will distance myself more from someone who does not accept no for an answer. Another key component about managing perception mediated empathy deficit is finding peers finding people with with shared similar experiences because they are going to intrinsically understand you better in a way that other people won't like I said before there's a reason that celebrities often end up dating other celebrities and that is primarily just because they're in a similar boat. They understand each other. My wife and I, we understand each other because we had a lot of very similar struggles in terms of being neurologically different from people, of being gifted and not being understood by our age peers, particularly in school, and also somewhat by our families, but you know it is what it is. Now those are external things from an internal perspective solidifying and consolidating your identity is actually really really important. And so what I mean by that is something that I've realized that happened very recently for me is that the public persona that I am cultivating and building, you know, my reputation in AI, my reputation on YouTube, so on and so forth, that is an external thing that I am building that I used to be wrapped up in. But as I realized something that the friends and family that I keep, they actually don't care about AI at all. And it was really weird at first because at first I thought it was really invalidating where I was like guys like I care about AI so much why won't you talk with me about AI and but then like my friends and family are like but Dave like we don't care about that we only care about you as a person and it took me a while to realize that because once I started seeing more transactional relationships outside in the world I realized that actually the fact that my closest friends and family don't care about artificial intelligence is actually a really good thing. And so my identity has shifted where I'm not as wrapped up in AI. It's still intensely important to me and I certainly identify with being, you know know an expert or whatever a thinker a communicator. But I also have a separate personal identity that has nothing to do with it. So for instance you know one of my best friends from a long time were working on building his boat together has nothing to do with artificial intelligence and he doesn't even really care. And at first I thought that was a problem but now I actually realize that those are the kind of relations to pay attention to. And then finally, acceptance. One thing that I realized is that there's no point in fighting human nature. Some of this is just how people are, some of this is just how society is. I don't make the rules, I can't change the rules, all I can do is play the game as best I can. Yep, so thank you.
