{"text": " She's been doing okay. Thank you for asking. She obviously is going through a lot right now. Yesterday was the viewing of Dave. There was two separate viewing times. We were there for a couple hours each time. There was people coming in and saying their prayers and getting to see him in the casket. Very sad. I'm not good around death, so I don't really, I just feel weird around those situations. But she was surprisingly very strong yesterday, and then today was the funeral, and obviously she broke down crying, and I don't blame her. It's just rough right now. I'm just, you know, the whole family's here supporting her. And I just want to say from my heart, thank you for everybody as well. That has been, um, you know, giving me your condolences and your prayers and just being here for, um, not only, you know, my family, but more importantly, my sister, she needs it the most right now. Truly it does. Like, I don't want to believe it. Obviously we have to accept it, but it's just such a bizarre situation. Never in a million years would I have thought that this could be the outcome. Obviously, Julian had a lot of issues. He was in the hospital for a very long time. There was always that possibility. And I feel like a lot of the family kind of prepared for a possibility of that happening. But for Dave to go a possibility of that happening, but for Dave to go a couple days later, that's just so tragic, such a horrible situation. And like I said, we all feel very, very bad for my sister. Two things that I want to address real quick. When Dave first passed, the next day my sister posted something on her Facebook about the situation and then obviously got an overwhelming amount of people responding She just felt like it was too much so she took down the post I started getting a lot of messages on our social media people freaking out people asking me what's going on people are like, you know Basically bitching at me. They're like yo, like how are you posting? you know, basically bitching at me. They're like, yo, like, how are you posting, you know, random stuff right now and like not describing the situation or what's going on? Like, how come you're not telling us anything? And truthfully, it wasn't my place. Like, it was not my place to say anything until, you know, Sabrina was truly ready. And then within a 24 hour period, she ended up posting, I think like another one or two things and took them down and then I had a conversation with her I was like look you know obviously you're going through a lot right now I understand that the fans are freaking out let me know when you let me know when you think it's best that you know we say something originally she was gonna be in the video she felt like it was too much She asked me to be in the video at first and and she decided to not go through with it It was just a lot on her obviously, right? So I was like, look, I'm gonna make something very short just kind of you know, give you guys an update what's going on So you've got that understanding? But yeah, it truly was not my place to say unless you know Sabrina was okay with that, of course So that's why that situation happened. I was just keeping my mouth shut. The other thing I want to address is yesterday, I posted a picture of Julie and I, and people were like, why are you smiling in such a sad situation, like giving me shit? And I'm like, yo, yeah, it's a very sad. But like if I'm taking a photo with my person, I'm not gonna be like Like sad and like weird, you know, obviously I'm gonna smile like it wasn't even like a crazy smile It's just like a like a half-cracked smile I don't know why people care so much but yeah, even in rough times you gotta stay positive, right? so, I don't know why you didn't have to address this is just odd but whatever no matter what the situation is you can't change what has already happened so all you can do is accept and keep moving forward and try and stay positive so you know that's what not only I am doing right now but my entire family just it We just gotta keep going strong. Yes, my family has been constantly staying at her house, you know, making sure that she's not there alone. She doesn't want to leave the house, which, you know, I totally understand. Like, she doesn't want to come to my family's sleepover, which is okay, you know, that's her choice. My parents have been taking turns, you know, sleeping at her house back and forth, like, every night. I'm just gonna make sure someone's there with her right now. So this is an odd situation for me because My heart feels so bad for my sister that I don't even take into consideration like my own feelings Obviously, you know, I'm truly upset and like I feel terrible for not only my sister, for Dave's entire family, you know, for my family. And I feel like I'm feeling more pain for everyone but myself right now, which is which is odd. I've never been in that situation. Truthfully, there's only been like one other major death in my family, you know, since I've been alive, at least something that was very, very close with and that was my grandpa when I was nine. So that hit me really hard. You know, at that time, but I don't know, I feel like I've been so absorbed on just, you know, feeling for everyone else that I'm haven't really been feeling for myself. It's such a weird situation. Don't get me wrong, there's been plenty of times where it's hit me and I sit there and I break down crying. And I just think about like the random moments of Dave and you know, Sabrina. And I think of the emotional don't get me wrong. There's been plenty of times where it's hit me and I sit there and I break down crying and I just think about like the random moments of Dave and you know Sabrina and I think of the most random stuff too. Like I'll just be in my car driving I start thinking about Dave and I'm like, wow, Dave had really good hair like it's like stupid random thoughts like that and then I start getting upset and then I start thinking about like board rides and stuff like that, that we'd go on. We go on little trips. We went to Disney with Sabrina and Dave and probably remember I've logged it. Um, you know, they came out there for a bit and stayed with us. It's just, it's a lot. And like, like I said, I don't feel like I'm good with dealing and coping with stuff like this. So, I don't know, it's weird. Now of course, not everybody knows what's going on in this situation, so I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna explain that to you real quick and anybody else that is kind of confused. So, basically my sister had a baby with her husband, Dave. His name was Julian. He was in the hospital for about eight months before he passed. He never came home. I never got to meet him, unfortunately. It was just a rough situation. And then only three days later, my sister's husband Dave, unfortunately, passed away from a heart attack. I personally feel as if he just had a broken heart and it was just a lot on him and I just feel really bad. That's the situation. So Julian was cremated and he had a couple of different urns with ashes and one of those went to Dave and he is holding him in his hand in the coffin. So he'll always have a little piece of him forever. I want to answer this without being like too descriptive. Just out of respect for my sister. Basically, I went next door to let Hazel and Gio play together. I always let them play every day. Like, you know, bring Hazel over. I'm like Gio play together. I always let them play every day. I like, you know, bring Hazel over. I'm like, Gio, he comes out and he plays. I let them next door. I went back to go talk to my dad. I was talking to him for a bit. I let Gio come back home. And then my dad was like, freaking out. He's like, Sabrina just called me saying Dave had a heart attack. And that's like all he knew. So we rushed over to her house and the ambulance was there, a bunch of police officers and I don't feel as if I should say much more than that. But it's just weird rethinking in the situation right now.
