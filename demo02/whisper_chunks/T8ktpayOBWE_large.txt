{"text": " Morning, everybody. David Shapiro here with episode two of the systems thinking series of videos. Today, we're going to be talking about perspectives. Perspectives probably doesn't mean what you think it means. Before we jump in, we'll do a quick recap of episode one. The first thing that we did was I gave you a few examples of systems thinkers. There is Nikola Tesla, there is Thomas Edison, and Henry Ford. These are the most famous systems thinkers in history, some of the most famous ones. Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison were likely on the spectrum like I am, and so there's some intrinsic disposition towards thinking in a certain way. But Henry Ford, so far as I know, was neurotypical, but he understood the value of systems and studied them. And so that led to the second part, which is myths about intelligence. Certainly there are huge genetic factors in intelligence. Certainly, there are huge genetic factors in intelligence. No matter how you measure it, whether it's IQ test or multimodal or whatever, there is a strong genetic component of intelligence. Now, that being said, the brain is very highly plastic and a lot of intelligence comes down to things that you've practiced and things that you've learned and gained over time and so your intelligence Absolutely can change over time You know based on the books that you read the things that you practice but also like how much you sleep and how well you Take care of yourself Finally, we got to lists checklists and protocols and so basically the to lists, checklists, and protocols. And so basically the heart of systems thinking is the ability to break things down into lists or procedures or checklists or whatever. Basically creating structure, extracting structure from something. And then the next higher order of that kind of structure is creating models or hierarchies, which are just a kind of structure is creating models or hierarchies which are just a kind of list, but it's layers of abstraction for instance. Okay, so with that recap of episode one, let's move into episode two. So the first kind of perspective that I want to teach you about for systems thinking is the global perspective or the global point of view. This could also be called a holistic point of view. So basically what you do to practice this is whatever problem you're looking at or whatever thing you're trying to understand, just take a step back. Look at the entire planet or the entire universe depending on what it is that you're trying to understand. And so why do this? There's a few reasons. One is not everything, not everyone is doing things the same way and so you can avoid insular views if you take a look across the entire world and say, okay, how are other people approaching this? How are other people thinking about this. And some examples include things like health care economics and education. So one thing occurred to me many years ago as I was debating with people online about health care and education in other countries and most people have a very insular view. They only look at their experience in education a very hyper local view. So for instance here on the East Coast, we are rarely aware of how health care and education is done on the West Coast. That's in the same country, just in America, let alone how things vary in other nations. Now of course every now and then there will be a documentary or a news segment that will shine a light on, you know, health care in France or Iceland or Scandinavia or whatever. Excuse me. But you don't need to wait until something comes along and shines the light for you. You can very deliberately take a step back. And there are plenty of good resources. You just, you know, say for instance you're looking at education you can just do a quick Google search like how does education work in Finland or whatever and so the one of the points is that a variety of thought is good if for no other reason that it expands the realm of what you know is possible and so that way you don't have to spend any time reinventing the wheel that other people have already solved. Also, looking at other cultures or other schools of thought from the outside is often a very effective way to see other people's gaps. And then by virtue of that, you become aware of your own gaps. And so it can serve as a very good mirror to look globally or universally depending on what it is that you're trying to solve or think about. Another aspect of taking a holistic view or a global view of things is that you can start to see an interconnectedness in all things. So typically someone has to be trained to think this way. So for instance, if you are a political science major or a macroeconomics specialist or whatever, you're trained to think like, okay, there's inputs and outputs and there's diplomatic relations and that sort of thing, but you don't need a master's degree in order to train yourself to think this way. And so for instance you know there's a phrase like no man is an island. And this is true for everyone on the entire planet. So you know everyone knows right. You look at you know made in China made in Taiwan or you know your pears are grown in Argentina or whatever. Right. And so the products and services that we use, we are already somewhat aware of the fact that they are global. But then when you take some time to actually look into like, how is it that global food trade works? How is it that global manufacturing works? Where is it that materials come from, so on and so forth, you start to see that level of interconnectedness. And then you add another layer, so going back to the models idea, there's the materials layer, there's the commerce layer, but then there's the geopolitical layer, right, that rests on top of that or below it depending on how you think of it, but geopolitics will influence things like trade deals or naval security or whatever. That all figures into logistics trains and so on and so forth. You see when you take a big step back that everything is interconnected. That being said, we evolved to think locally. You know whenever you watch an old-fashioned movie or read a high fantasy book and people talk about like, oh you know what's beyond the valley and we, the world is so big and we are so small and we only very recently even got a complete map of the entire world, we did not evolve to think globally. It is literally not possible for our brains to conceive of a planet worth of resources and land and people. There are more than 8 billion people on the planet, so it is not intuitive to us to think this way and it takes a lot of practice. Now that being said, as you learn about cultures and patterns of belief and patterns of behavior, as well as these different systems, you can develop an intuition for it, but it is not a natural intuition. It's kind of like learning about quantum physics. Everything that you know about physics intuitively, Newtonian physics, does not apply to quantum physics. And so you can develop an intuition for quantum physics over time with practice and study. Another thing is because the world is so big, by taking a big step back you can make the big picture small. Because one thing that I've realized is that many people really struggle with big picture thinking and that's because it's like the tiny goldfish looking up. And of course it's overwhelming, right? It's big and scary and overwhelming. So what you do is you take a step back and you instead take the perspective of someone looking outside of the fishbowl in. Because then looking at a fishbowl is much easier to look at the whole system. If you're the fish inside the fishbowl, it's difficult to understand the system. If you're outside of the fishbowl, looking in, it's much easier. Make the big picture small, which is another way of making it more manageable in your head. Then it's like, oh, if I just literally just look at this picture and I like, oh, well, if I look at, if I just literally just look at this picture and I say, okay, well, here's India and here's Sri Lanka and here's China and Southeast Asia, right? It's like, it's all just, I can put my hand over it and that makes it mentally smaller, which changes the scale or the scope in my head. And I'm like, okay, so I'm thinking about, for instance, China's Silk Road Initiative or Belt and Road Initiative and it's like okay that's gonna go across here gotcha I see why they're trying to do this because it's a straight line straight from China over to the Caspian and Black Sea and then Mediterranean got it okay it makes sense and then here's China India and Russia ah got it that's why there's so much geopolitical tension over the here because there's three vastly different cultures with a lot of people all crammed in close to each other. So it's like, just taking that, it's like, oh, well, in that case, the geopolitics of this region actually is rather simple when you zoom out and you reduce the resolution. So yeah, that is taking a global POV or a holistic view of anything, the world, the problem. And one thing I want to say is that like this is a general concept. You can take a global POV of any system, whether it's a company or a car or whatever, but this is one of the easiest ones, especially when you're looking at social trends, cultural trends, economic trends, religious trends, that sort of thing, this practice is very helpful. And I will often look for an image of the entire Earth in order to frame it in my head. It kind of primes it to say, okay, let me look at the whole planet at arm's length, because if you just take a step back and look around, all I can see out my windows is my neighborhood. Right? And it's like, okay, that's what I mean by we evolved to think locally, but with the tools such as Google Earth or whatever, you can zoom out and look globally. Okay. So the second perspective to take is the long-term view. So you can zoom out physically based on space, but you can also zoom out temporally based on time. And so one thing that I like to do is take a big step back and look at historical trends. Look at, you know, not just like what happened last year or the year before, but look at centuries and millennia. And the reason that I say this is because, well, the best way that I've articulated it is that all of history is a countless unbroken threads of influence leading to this moment. So everything that happened in ancient Egypt, everything that happened in the Bronze Age, everything that happened in the Iron Age, everything that happened in medieval times, all of those are threads of influence that led to the reality we have today. And it is global, right? Same thing for the Islamic world, the Far East. All of history has this cross-linking influence. And so by zooming out on a temporal timeline or kind of shrinking the timeline, so you can say, okay, let's look at all of the last 10,000 years of human history. And that again makes it really small because then you're holding your hand out and just looking at all of time as a thumbnail and say, okay, that's one scale. How did we get to where we are? And so there's a few kinds of trends that you can look at. Religious trends, intellectual and philosophical movements, artistic and cultural movements, so on and so forth. And this is just, this is still a very, a relatively small time scale. So what other kinds of scales can you look at? Obviously there's the very short term, which is seconds, minutes, and hours. How do things change, you know, in the very short term. And these like seconds and minutes, this is what our brain will physically recognize, right? If something is moving too slow on the order of inches per hour, you won't physically notice it because you do not have the neural machinery to recognize it. What you'll have to do is you'll have to like leave a signpost somewhere and then come back and look at it later to see how far the snail has moved, for instance. Then days, weeks, and months, this is another timescale. This is taking one step back. Okay, how do things change over the course of days, weeks, and months, this is another time scale. This is taking one step back. Okay, how do things change over the course of days, weeks, months? So for instance, many biological changes, some of them happen in seconds, minutes, and hours, like breathing, eating, that sort of thing, sleeping. But then other things, like growing and healing, take days, weeks, and months. Well, actually, I guess growing if you're a child takes years, right? Years and decades. And then finally, the whole process of aging from birth to death, that's on the decades to centuries for those that are lucky to make it to centenarians. But then taking an even bigger step back, looking at all of life, all of humanity. Then you're talking about millennia, eons, and epochs, or epochs, where you can't even look at the last 10,000 years of human history in isolation. Why? Because humans didn't just come into existence at that point, depending on your belief structure, but we came from mammals. We came from the great apes. We came from proto-humans. We came from basically rodents or the hypothetical progenitor of all primates, all mammals today. And so it's like, okay, if you zoom all the way out and then zoom all the way out further to the origin of life, you know, what, three billion years ago, single-celled organisms, there are constant threads over the course of literally billions of years of influence. And so by zooming all the way out to those time scales, you can also get a different perspective and make things smaller and more manageable. Now, the opposite of all that is zooming in. So what we were just talking about was a holistic or top-down approach. You can also take a bottom-up or deconstructionist approach. So another behavior that you can do for systems thinking is, okay, so you get the global perspective, right? Let's say we're trying to look at economic trends in India, right? Okay, so you can look at aggregate numbers, you can look at the long-term history going back to the British Revolution, or British occupation of India and before that. But then, what if you take that big global perspective and then you zoom back in? So then what do you do? You might look at an individual person in India or an individual family. So that's what I mean by zooming in and kind of deconstructing it. So what is the life like for a typical Indian person in a village or a city or you know Mumbai or New Delhi or whatever. And so what you can do then is by examining each component of a larger system under a microscope whether a literal microscope or a metaphorical microscope you can challenge your assumptions and beliefs that you arrived at based on that zoomed out perspective. And so then what you do is you start to update your mental model by saying, okay here's all the tiny components that go into this kind of thing. And then as as you go you kind of pick apart the system bit by bit because all systems are made of components. And so then as you understand the components of a system you can test those components in isolation if possible. It's usually not fully possible because, again, no man is an island. But what you can do is you can, by zooming in, you can look at the interactions, linkages, and boundaries of the components inside the system. So for instance, if you're trying to look at national trends some of those interactions and linkages and boundaries are gonna be the family boundary, or the company boundary, or the municipal boundary, right? So by looking at those boundaries, many of which are nested, so you go back to the models and lists, right? It's a hierarchy, right? A nested hierarchy of, you know, the smallest unit is the individual, the next unit up is probably the family, next unit up might be extended family or community, so on and so forth. And so then you look at the internal interactions of those units, but then you also look at the interactions between those units at different layers and different scales. This allows you to, and also if you think of a microscope or a telescope, you can zoom out, you can zoom in, you can kind of pan around, that sort of thing, and that allows you to compare the micro to the macro so that you can start to create that hierarchy in your mind, that mental model in your mind that has those layers of abstractions. And so that's why I started episode one with lists and models and hierarchies because what you're doing in your mind if you practice zooming in and zooming out you're intuitively building up a hierarchy in your head and you can explicitly write it down as well. Now, finally, there are two kinds of things that you can look for. Behaviors, system behaviors. So there's aggregate behaviors. So aggregate behaviors is like, okay, what is the net effect? What is the final result of a billion people doing X, Y, or Z? And so the aggregate effect of, say, for instance, food consumption, you can say, okay, a billion people produce X million tons of carbon per day or whatever. Right? So that's an aggregate result or aggregate measurement. And then there's emergent behaviors. And so emergent behaviors are the behaviors that you can observe when you zoom out, but have no apparent cause when you zoom in. And so the most common thing for this is swarm behavior. So if you watch just a single ant or a single bee, you're not going to be able to understand their swarming behavior until you look at the whole colony or the whole hive. And the same thing is true of people. The emergent behavior of societies, of nations, is not going to be obvious from an individual. So for instance, military actions. If you ask an individual of any nation, what is the military gonna do? What, you know, would you join the military? Would you go kill someone, so on and so forth? The answer's generally gonna be no. People, by and large, are not belligerent. And yet, the emergent behavior of a whole nation is, you'll have, you know, a standing army of, for even small nations, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. For larger nations, for the largest nations, you'll have a standing army of over a million or more. And then you'll expend tremendous amounts of resources on weapons, expeditions, and ultimately destruction, which these are emergent behaviors that are not obvious by looking at the individual humans that make up a society. And so when people like Margaret Thatcher said there is no such thing as society, there's only individuals and families, that was a total lie. Societies and nations and stuff absolutely are unique entities that have those emergent behaviors that are not going to be obviously driven by any individual single behavior. So by zooming in, you can say, okay, where's the disconnect, right? So in the case of ants and bees and swarms, or humans and military actions, for instance, you can say, okay, how do you get from that zoomed out thing where the United States Department of Defense has three to four million employees, but then on an individual scale, no single person really wants to go to another nation just to kill people. Some people do, but they are an extreme minority. Most people just wanna get by, right? And so then you say, okay, what are the steps that link those behaviors? And what are the individual behaviors that link up to those aggregate and emergent results? Okay, so in terms of thinking of models, right? We talked about models in the first episode as layers of abstraction or hierarchies. This is actually one of the most intuitive ways to think about complex systems, and that is to think about every complex system as a unique life form. So all complex systems have lifelike characteristics. There's inputs, there's outputs, there's needs, reactions, and internal mechanisms. And in fact, all organisms are themselves complex systems. The human body is one of the most complex systems in the entire universe. But we're used to it because we have one, which makes it easy and intuitive for us to say, oh, well, what if we think of a complex system as an organism? Because again, just by looking at your skin cells, you're not going to be able to infer the emergent behavior of a human. You can't look at someone's cuticles under a microscope and say, ah, yes, this is a criminal, or whatever. So again, that difference in scale, but also just by using this as a metaphor. So computers, as a former IT professional, computers are a great example of this. So whether you as a former IT professional, computers are a great example of this. So whether you're talking about an individual computer like your phone or large computer systems like giant cloud systems like what I used to work on, I would always think of them as organisms, right? They have their needs. There's particular care and feeding. And so for instance, when I would make a change to the storage network of my systems, and one of the largest computer systems I was responsible for was like two to three petabytes of data, right? So there's a huge amount of data. And there's backups, there's all kinds of processes going on, there's nested processes, there's processes on a small scale, there's network-wide processes. And so what I realized is that when I thought about the computer systems that I was responsible for as an organism, gigantic organism, it's like, okay, I made a change, and now it's going to take some time for that change to circulate. It's going to take some time for that change to digest. And so, for instance, think about adding a vaccine to a human, right? You inject the vaccine, but it can take two weeks or longer before that person is inoculated against whatever problem there was. The same thing is true of computer systems. Say for instance you deploy a security patch. It doesn't go out immediately, it has to wait for a reboot cycle. And then you don't reboot everything at once, there's this kind of soaking time. Meanwhile, there's all kinds of ongoing life-like processes like backups and databases and queries and stuff, all going on all at the same time in parallel, massively parallel just like a human body because it's not like your heart beats and then your kidney pumps and then your liver does something. No, all of your organs are working in parallel along with your brain, right? You're digesting, you're thinking, you're breathing, you're doing all these things all at once, all the time. And so, computer systems are a very accessible way of thinking about something as being alive or lifelike. Now, every complex system has lifelike characteristics, whether it's economics, education, or legal and political systems, right? Nations, cities, states. You know, you can say like, okay, well, an individual in a nation is like a skin cell on a body, right? It's more metaphorical than analogous, but I think you get my meaning. Companies, businesses, and organizations of all kinds are like this, where the organs of that are going to be the individual officers or the groups within those companies. And then finally, internet, social media, and other communities are also very much like living organisms, where there's going to be emergent behaviors that are not going to be obvious from the individual participants. And so finally, by looking at these things, you say, okay, well, how does this organism behave? Right? You look at a gorilla and you say, okay, well, you know, they beat their chest and they have, they form these social groups and so on. How does that differ from a chameleon, right? A lizard here. And why? You can look at differences of intelligence and other components and stuff, and then you say, okay, well, what does this organism need to thrive? And you can have that same mentality and look at nations, communities, corporations, all of the above, you say, what does this organism, what does this entity need in order to thrive? And so that wraps up thinking the organic or the organism model of systems thinking. And then finally, the last one that I want to leave you with today is thinking in fractals. So this is going to be the most abstract lesson so far. Now, for those who are not familiar, a fractal is a mathematical pattern that zooms in or out to infinite. No matter how much you zoom into a fractal, there's going to be more detail to see, and also no matter how much you zoom out. So there's an infinite amount of zoom in or out, and you can pan across the thing and no matter how close you look there's always going to be more detail. But what can happen is as you zoom out you're going to notice patterns that you couldn't see when you're too zoomed in. Likewise when you zoom in you're going to discover new patterns that are nested within larger patterns. And so by looking for patterns at different scales, and this is different time scales, different physical scales, emotional scales, whatever, biological scales, by learning to think in terms of fractals, of okay what are the patterns at this scale and how do they fit into the larger pattern, because again everything is interconnected. There's no actual boundaries in this. There are apparent boundaries, right, where you see a pattern, right, you see this like kind of seahorse looking pattern and then there's a gap, right, but that is a pattern or that is a boundary that you notice and imagine is there, but the closer you look, the more you realize there actually isn't any boundaries. There's just the apparent boundaries based on contrast. And so when you look for patterns at different scales, you're going to find interactions, recursions, and parallels. So the interactions are like, okay, it almost looks like, you know, these patterns kind of push against these other ones, and then there's this like anti-affinity. Then in other cases, you're going to see these patterns where they almost seem to draw in, right? Where this one, it kind of collapses and spirals in, where you have this condensation. And that's even more intense here, where the pattern actually is implosive rather than explosive. And then here, you see almost a very rigid kind of pattern where it's like, okay, there's almost like a rule that says you cannot infiltrate this circle. Why is that? But that's what I mean by noticing those parallels, those recursions and interactions. And then what you can do is you can look for the underlying rules, the commonality that underpins these systems. And then one thing I want to point out is, you probably already know this, but fractals appear everywhere in nature. Your heartbeat follows a fractal pattern because the way that the nerve signals propagate across your heart. And it's also the way that your body keeps time. So there's several, again, there's several layers of abstraction because there's the brainstem which helps monitor and manage the whole body, but then there's the way that the signals propagate down your vagus nerve and plenty of other complex interactions that all result in controlling your heart rate. Many plants have fractal patterns. You'll see this most common in cauliflower and other flowers. Coastlines. The coastline paradox have a fractal nature where depending on how far in you zoom or out It's actually almost impossible to measure the actual length of a coastline Crystals, all crystals, but especially snowflakes follow fractal patterns and then finally lightning, rivers, clouds, and mountains all have aspects of Fractal geometry in them. And so it's like, well, why? Is there math behind it? And so this gets to the question of, is math just a description for the universe, or is math the actual operating system of the universe? And there's a lot of debate around this, so I'm not going to make any claims one way or the other, but I will point out that understanding the mathematical patterns behind everything and how there's very complex interactions is one of the most important keys to systems thinking. So as a recap before we close this video, there were kind of five different methods or techniques to systems thinking that I talked about. First is zooming out to take a global perspective. This is one of my favorite activities to do and it's how I came to understand things like neoliberalism and the status quo of economics. The second thing is taking the same long view but from a timeline perspective. And this is how I came to my understanding of post-nihilism. By looking at the succession of events of intellectual, religious, spiritual, and cultural events and trends, I said, oh, where we're at is the nihilistic crisis because that is the train wreck that has been unfolding for the last few hundred years and so therefore what we need is post-nihilism. And I just listed it out, again, going for that list. I said, here's the sequence of events and here is the next logical event in that pattern, basically. Number three is zooming in. So you can zoom in on a temporal scale, you can zoom in on a physical scale, so on and so forth. It's the same thing as zooming out just in the opposite direction. Number four is looking at things as organisms. And so if you'll say like, okay, if you had to characterize America as an organism, how does this organism behave? Or if you had to characterize a company as an organism, how does that organism behave? And what does it need, what makes those organisms thrive. And then finally, number five, understanding the fractal nature of everything in nature. Knowing that math is either a way to describe what's happening, or it's actually driving what's happening. Again, I'm not gonna make an assertion one way or another, but there is a very powerful parallel between fractal patterns in pure math and then the patterns that we see emerging in nature. And so if you practice all of these, this is going to get you one step closer to very much being a systems thinker like myself or those three inventors that I mentioned at the beginning of the video.
