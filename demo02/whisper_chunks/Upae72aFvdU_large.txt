{"text": " Morning everybody, David Shapiro here with another life video. So today I'm going to introduce the topic of boundaries. A few rules to protect yourself as a free human. So first, what do I mean by free human? As some of you are aware, I'm a fan of Sorelle Amore, who is currently running her own free human project. In fact, I think she coined the term. So all credit goes to her. I am working on the same thing, and so I am grabbing my own torch, so to speak, carrying the message. But the idea is it's basically articulating a new way to live, a different way to be. All right, so for some context, for some framing to the rest of this video, there's something that you need to know. One is that the freer you become, the more things change. And so what I mean by that is that some people will resent you for it and they'll engage in what's called change back behaviors so change back behavior is the subtle criticism or gaslighting or Just little levers of control that people have like oh, well Why don't you have a normal job or why don't you do this or that? or they'll imply that they have control when they don't. They'll just casually tell you what to do and the more you say no, the stronger some of those imperatives become. And in this case, well, we'll get into how to handle that later. Other people will be in awe of you. Some people will just be like, wow, like you escaped. I could never do that. And they'll put you on a pedestal. And putting you on a pedestal is, can be just as bad as resentment and change back behaviors. Because if someone puts you on a pedestal, it says, no, I have deified you. Therefore, you're not allowed to step off that pedestal. Otherwise, you offend me and you owe me that reverence. So again whether it's resentment or awe both of them can result in entitled behavior. Another thing is some people just won't get it. They'll just kind of shut down and won't even be able to have a conversation around what it means to pick an alternative lifestyle. They'll just change the subject or something like that. And some people will be totally ambivalent. You know, I have a friend that I told that I was semi-retired and she's just like, what do you mean by semi-retired? And I was like, oh, well, I focus on YouTube and Patreon and she's like, congrats. And that was the end of the conversation. Like, she's like, OK, good, good for you. Moving on. Now, one thing that I will say is that disordered people and what I mean by disordered is any number of conditions that make someone emotionally or personality wise or mentally unwell. There's all kinds of disorders out there and you can look at it from a clinical sense or just from an emotional social sense whatever but the the fact of the matter is is that disordered people will react the strongest because in some cases disordered people are controlled entirely by their emotions or they have very very toxic beliefs about themselves and the world, or also toxic beliefs about control. And now that being said, even ordinary people who might still be controlled by their emotions may also react negatively or strongly. And so, basically, I'm not trying to say like, oh, the whole world will be out to get you. Some people will not appreciate any level of freedom or change. I've talked about this in other videos, particularly in my authenticity video where it was like, you know, how dare you step out of line. That's what I was referring to. And after thinking about it for about a week, I realized that's what's happening. So this video is a follow on to that authenticity video the freer you become the more authentic you become you're going to run into some of the stuff so here's some tips that I've gathered over the years and that I'm having to remind myself actually of. So here's the simple rules. These this is just a handful of rules I don't want to inundate you with like a million rules. So I paired it down to kind of the four best rules that I have. And I remind myself of these often more and more lately. So number one, no is a complete sentence. I think I heard this in the context, it was probably on like witches versus patriarchy or something. But it's a reminder that you don't have to explain yourself You like this is a free country. This is a free world We value individual liberty in this in this nation, and if you tell someone no That that that's all that that's that's it as as a lawyer friend said the only person who can make you do anything as a judge and as a lawyer friend said, the only person who can make you do anything as a judge. And she meant that kind of like it was serious at the at the at the time, but then it was just like it kind of became a joke, a household joke, like, no, unless someone's a judge like they can't. No one can order you to do anything. Not your children, not your family, not your boss, like individual liberty, man. That's a lot of people struggle with that, particularly older Americans. It's like, oh, it's a free country, but it's free for me, but not for thee. And I will say that some of the people that struggle with individual freedom the most, particularly when it's younger people, are older people and men. So rule number two is say no by default. So many of us are caught in what, uh, what some have coined human giver syndrome or codependency or any number of other things where we are just treated as if other people's expectations are now our responsibilities. And so by saying no, by default, by learning and by cultivating this habit, we say no. I don't care who you are or what you're asking or what you're suggesting. I know what's best for me and I'm gonna make my own choices. This gets, these two, no is a complete sentence and say no by default, this gets people the most riled up. Number three, trust but verify. So if someone does want to take your time or modify your course or involve you in anything, sure, you know, most people have good intentions, but verify. I have found that the verification step causes most people to just buzz off if they are not serious, and I'll talk more about that in a minute. And then finally, don't jade. notification step causes most people to just buzz off if they are not serious. And I'll talk more about that in a minute. And then finally, don't jade. There's a lot to unpack with don't jade. So I won't even start here. Excuse me. Okay. So no is a complete sentence. You don't owe anyone an explanation ever. A lot of people will say like, well, why? Because I said so. That's it. And if people don't accept no, if they don't accept like, I don't want to, then that means they struggle with boundaries. And people who, who, because like, I think from my perspective, if I ask someone like out on a date or if I ask someone to do something and they say no, I'm like, okay, that's the end of the conversation for anyone who for whom no is not the end of a conversation. I don't want them in my life. So some examples on LinkedIn, I get approached by people all the time, usually salespeople, and they'll offer me something. I'm like, no, thanks, not right now. And they're like, well what about this? And I'm like, block. I told you no. That was your answer. Particularly in America, the sales culture that we have says that no is just a barrier. It's overcoming a negative. And it's like, nope, that's actually toxic. That is actually manipulative. And so in the most innocent cases, people just, because of their age, because of the culture they grew up in, they think no is soft, no is just a suggestion. I'm here to tell you, that shit has to change. If you come from a culture or demographic where no is just a suggestion, you are entitled and you need to stop. And you're probably old. Young people get this. Older people tend to just like ignore your no. As again, particularly older men. Disordered people and toxic people will try and sucker you into debates about like, well, but why? I don't have, I don't owe you an explanation. I said no. If you respect me as a person, you will know that my no is serious. And so I am a big fan of the block button, of banishing people. The more I block people out of my life, the more more I block people out of my life, the more that I kick them out of my life, the better my life becomes. And also the more authentic I become, the better people I attract into my life, and I have no shortage of people, good people in my life. And so what I have found is that the more ruthlessly I block toxic people and disordered people, or even just people who don't respect me the way that I know that I deserve to be respected. That makes more space for good people in my life. And this is another point that toxic people will argue, well what about that what about this promise that you made me? It's like well one, I didn't make that promise. That was an expectation that you imagined. And two, no, like I don't owe you anything. I was on a call yesterday with someone who wanted me to attend a conference and and he made me he asked me to justify why I should be invited to the conference and I'm like dude you came to me. You asked me to come to the conference and now you're trying to nag me. I told him no. No is a complete sentence. The flip side of that is say no by default. As I mentioned, some people feel entitled to your time and they get upset if you say no. Some people really struggle with being told no. I have a story with this. So many, many years ago I was probably, I was probably building a desk. I like building my own desks because, well, I like them to be particular dimensions and shapes and stuff. And it's also cheaper. So I was loading wood into my Subaru, because I had a Subaru at the time, and there was a piece that was a little bit heavy and I was struggling a little bit. And an older gentleman, well, I use the word gentleman very judiciously, older guy walks up and he's like, why don't you do it this this and this way? And I just kind of looked over my shoulder like, I've got this, like I didn't know nobody asked for your help. And and I was like, no thanks, I've got this. And he's like, well, I'm just trying to help. And it's like, OK, well, if your help comes with the threat of you blowing up, I don't fucking want your help. And so he felt entitled to give my help and entitled just by virtue of the fact that he wanted my time and attention, that I now owed it to him, and that he would get violent, verbally violent, and possibly physically violent if I didn't give it to him. That was the first time I had that kind of experience. And then ever since then, I understand women's perspective on men a lot more. And my fiance and I had the same thing happen on the walking trails in the middle of the pandemic where there was a really big guy who looked somewhat disheveled and it's the middle of the pandemic so we move over and the guy just blew up he's like well you guess I look like I'm homeless or something and it's like well you sound like an asshole so this guy felt entitled to control our behavior and our space even though and then he threatened our safety because we made him feel ashamed of his behavior. So anyways we said no, we moved on and if you say no by default, if you get in the habit of just saying no, my time is under my control, a lot of people will learn. A lot of people will just say, okay, you know, those are fine. The people who don't learn, the people who insist on taking up your time, those are the ones that you need to avoid. Saying no by default, getting in that habit, prioritizes your freedom and your autonomy. So personal autonomy is like the key thing that I'm realizing about being a free human. It's also okay to disappoint people. The science is out is that people actually respect you more if you establish boundaries and enforce boundaries. The people who don't respect you more for boundaries, those are toxic people. These are people who are codependent, who are narcissists, who are just super insecure or anxious or whatever. And I do have a lot of empathy for some people like that. Some people are just very lonely and to them a boundary feels very threatening. Some people see boundaries as a challenge. Oh how dare you tell me no! I'm gonna figure out how to get through your defenses. Bish those people. Now, trust but verify. As I mentioned just a few minutes ago, most people have good intentions. This is just statistically true. 99% of people are completely harmless or benign. Or even just have, know whatever. However plenty of people with good intentions can still be destructive. As I mentioned at the beginning of this video this often comes down to culture and demographics because someone who might be a pillar of morality in their community in their age or whatever, they don't understand that their behavior is out of time, that their behavior is anachronistic. In other cases, there are people who innocently feel lonely or innocently feel insecure, but then they make you do emotional labor. And I actually forgot to put that term in. People who make you do emotional labor. And I actually forgot to put that term in. People who make you do emotional labor are generally disordered. And consider avoiding them. That's my button, smash that block button. Not everyone does that. Some people have more tolerance for that kind of thing than I do. But also since I have a public persona, people tend to feel a lot more entitled to my time, and so I understand why a lot of influencers just won't ever respond to anyone. I get it now. Now, that being said, the 1% of people with bad intentions, and again, keep in mind that most of them think they have good intentions. This is where the gaslighting comes in. There are plenty of people with bad intentions who think they have good intentions. Most of them will just evaporate with a little bit of pushback. And this is what I mean by verify. So if it's on the Internet ask for references links and just honestly ask for someone's intentions. I've had more than a few people just kind of disappear on me when they like reach out to me and they want to talk and I'm like, okay, what do you want? And they're like, well, I don't know. It's like, okay, so they were just acting on an impulse to connect with me because they wanted my time. They didn't want anything else. They just wanted to feel significant or feel powerful or feel important enough to have my time. And that happens not, you don't have to be an influencer for that to happen. People will just do that. I've had before before I was internet famous I've had people just call me out of the blue wanting to talk for no apparent reason just because they were lonely or I don't know. So ask for candor. This is partly because I'm autistic. I don't play games, and by games I mean like schmoozing. Schmoozing to me is just an obvious manipulation strategy. Like oh hey, I'm going to butter you up for five minutes of pointless chit chat so that you feel more confident and relaxed and comfortable. And it's like, I actually don't care. And I actually think less of people who schmooze and so I was on a call a few weeks ago with someone who wanted to work with me and and the call was just it was weird I probably should have gotten off of it earlier and then I was like you know the the one of the guys that I was on the other side was being a little bit cagey and just Strange and I said, okay, I'm gonna ask for some candor. What is going on here? What do you guys want? And they and this this guy who refused to? Like reveal anything about his history or whatever. He accused me of being cagey. He's like, oh well you're talking about you know information that you can't share and I'm like dude I have like 200 repositories on github and 200 videos on YouTube like and I'm not I'm the one who doesn't share. So when you ask for candor toxic people will reveal themselves quick fast and in a hurry because the the biggest thing about toxic and disordered people is they thrive on plausible deniability. will reveal themselves quick, fast, and in a hurry because the biggest thing about toxic and disordered people is they thrive on plausible deniability. So if you are candid and you ask for candor and they don't do it, they have big red flag because healthy people with good intentions, they have no problem being candid. Trust your gut instinct. You don't need to explain it. If your gut instinct says this is bad, walk away. It's fine. And again, in line with candor, a lack of clarity or a bunch of ambiguity is a huge red flag. If you ask someone to clearly state what they want or what they need or what they expect and they can't, that's the reason that they cannot articulate it clearly is because they are operating entirely on impulse. They just want something from you. And some people, some very slippery people, are really good at confabulating, like making up bullshit reasons. But again, that's where you trust your gut instinct. It's like, okay, that sound, if it doesn't pass the sniff test, the sniff test is great because it's like, this doesn't smell right. It doesn't smell good. So people that are evasive, also huge red flag. Anyone who avoids a direct question, it's like, what's going on there? Okay. So like I've literally just ended calls when I ask someone a direct question. It's like what's going on there. Okay. So like I've literally just ended calls when I ask someone a direct question. I'm like, okay, this isn't going to work and I have no regrets on that. Fragility is probably the biggest red flag. If you are interacting with someone and you get the sense that if you say the wrong thing, they're going to blow up or melt down. I walk away from those relationships quick, fast, and in a hurry. I haven't walked away from them fast enough in the past. So basically, yeah, all of these are, are red flags. And I personally have a one strike rule. Someone does transgresses any of these bad enough and I'm like, not worth the time. Yeah, and if you need reinforcements on the verify part, talk to someone that you trust. If you got a bad vibe, talk it out with someone. And cause getting that perspective will reinforce it. And it's just like, yeah, man, I block people. I usually block probably about five to 10 people a week, but on different platforms, that's different for me because you know, I'm on YouTube and stuff But I will say even before that You know, I would block people Finally don't Jade So this this acronym comes from Al-Anon, actually, a 12-step program. I heard it through the grapevine. I am not a member of Al-Anon, by the way. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But I do get a lot of wisdom from people that I know in my network. And when I heard this one, I was like, hold on. First I love acronyms. They're great mnemonic devices. And so I was like, what does this mean? Don't Jade means don't justify, argue, defend, or excuse. Now normally, don't jade is used for people who are in relationships with alcoholics. Don't justify the alcoholic's behavior, don't argue about the alcoholic's behavior, don't defend the alcoholic's behavior, and don't excuse the alcoholic's behavior. But I found that this acronym applies universally to all disordered behavior or all unacceptable behavior. So if someone justifies their bad behavior at you, they'll make excuses or explain why your concerns are invalid. Huge red flag. But I did this because... It's like, no. I said no. And you did it anyways it's that simple if someone wants to argue about your boundaries if someone wants to say like oh well why why is it that your needs matter or why is it why is like you're you're just too sensitive or whatever if someone's gonna argue when you say no or when you state your needs, that is also toxic behavior. Again, this is predominantly for people that are otherwise... well, anyways. Other people will defend their bad behavior as though it's good. Why are you criticizing me? This is how I'm supposed to be. Or, why are you attacking me personally? This is just who I am. It's like, okay, well if that's honestly who you are then you're an asshole. I don't want anything to do with you. And then finally people that excuse their bad behavior. If people say, well whatever, I'm not going to change it or this is your problem. It's like, okay, well if you make it my problem, bye. And specifically, again, banish people who do this. And if you do this, then stop. When I learned this acronym, I was like, ooh, these are actually really good rules. If someone criticizes me, so perfect example, this is great for relationships. After I learned this, don't jade, I realized that there were some patterns that I had from toxic relationships in the past and poor communication paradigms that I learned from my family of origin. And my fiance would say something like, hey, I don't like it when you do that. And your first instinct is to defend yourself and be like, well, but this is why I did it. And then I learned, no, anytime you have the impulse to justify something that you did that hurt someone else, don't. Anytime you want to argue about that, don't. You can discuss it. Here's the difference. What, what is left after you remove justification, arguing, defending, excusing, is first listening, hear them out, and then discuss it. Say, you know, help me understand why this didn't work for you. This was actually a really big thing earlier in my relationship with my fiance as we were learning each other. I was like, why did this? And I didn't ask why, like I'm not asking her to justify herself. I was genuinely curious, like, why was this upsetting to you? And she did the same thing for me, by the way. Like what's going on here? Let's unpack what the problem is. And then it's like, okay, I see what I did wrong, so I will modify my behavior in the future. And the behavior modification, that's the key. I have found that my ability to forgive people is nearly infinite so long as they demonstrate growth and that they can modify their behavior. But if someone digs in, if they dig in their heels and they say, no, I'm not going to change for you, great. Carry on. Bye. All right. So here's some final thoughts. If you don't believe me, I've got a whole list of YouTube channels you can look up. So one is Katie Morton. She is a therapist who has a lot of good stuff on dealing with disordered people and boundaries and all kinds of other stuff. She cranks YouTube videos out like as fast as I do. She's been doing it for a lot longer. She explains things really well. Another is Teal Swan. Teal Swan has been making videos for a long long time and she has read a lot of the same books that I have and she has a really good way of explaining these relationship dynamics, explaining why they happen the way they do and how to identify them. I don't always agree with Teal Swan. It's really interesting. Pretty much in every video there's one thing that I'm just like, ooh, yikes, I don't agree with that. So I'm sure there's people that disagree with me. It's fine. But I just want to point that out that like we'll take everything from the internet with a grain of salt. Alright moving on. Cinematherapy is a really good one because one it's entertaining and two they use on-screen examples to talk about things like boundaries and relationship issues and manipulation and gaslighting and so on. And then finally Charisma on Command. As I was becoming more popular, more famous, I was like, okay I need to I need to learn how celebrities handle, you know, trash talk and stuff like that. And so I binged a whole bunch of Charisma on Command videos and I've used them. And they talk about manipulation, they talk about bullying, they talk about all the same kind of stuff that I'm talking about. So again, disordered people don't know that they're disordered and they'll often accuse you of being disordered or they'll insinuate that you're the crazy one. This is gaslighting. Some disordered people know that they're disordered and they will be super slippery about it. This is often why they will accuse other people of being disordered. It's like, no it's actually you. And it's like when you take a step back and look at that behavior it's so childish. It's like I know I am or I know you are but what am I? Right? Like this is how really deeply immature some disordered people are. And so another term for this is called crazy making behavior. So if you think of someone and just like, okay, that person is a basket of anxiety, that person is just a dumpster fire, that is your emotional brain saying that is a person who is rife with crazy making behavior and it's okay to just walk away from those people. And again, even people who are mostly healthy might still react negatively or strongly to your boundaries. It goes back to that change back behavior. So change back behavior is you're changing something and I don't like it. I want you to go back to the way things were. And again, this is a dynamic that plays out for whatever reason. Once people have a set idea of who you are, they don't want you to change ever, which is really ironic because learning and growing is actually really important. Like we are supposed to change by virtue of learning and growing. And then finally one of my favorite catchphrases is, talk sense to a fool and he'll call you foolish. This quotation is 2,500 years old. Yeah, leave it to the Greeks with their rhetoric to figure out how to put this. But any time that you feel like you're making sense to someone and they say that you're the one who's in the wrong, maybe this is what's going on. So I hope this was helpful. Thanks for watching.
