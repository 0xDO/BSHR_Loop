{"text": " Morning, everybody. David Shapiro here with a video. Also, you might have noticed the little window in the top left or right, I don't remember, is bigger. I got an idea. Someone suggested making it bigger because I'm very expressive and you want to see my face more. I don't know. Let me know if it works for you. Anyways, today's video is career tips for low-needs autistic adults. This was an idea that popped up from several places and I posted all about it and I got some good questions and tips. And plus, yeah, whatever. There's some disclaimers, put it that way. So everyone is different. So some of this, or this is mostly coming from my own personal experience, plus some of the stuff that I've read in books and online, and some stuff that various friends have told me. So, disclaimer number one, none of this should be construed as actual legal advice. I recommend that you contact an attorney if you ever have any questions. Yes, they are expensive, but they are there to help you, and because attorneys are very rule-based people, I actually have a pretty easy time communicating with them. It's just a matter of what rules they're operating by. Some people have had drastically different experiences from me, so some of the stuff that I say may not apply or might even be the opposite of your experience. That being said, some people have had similar experiences. I really found Unmasking Autism by Devon price to be really reassuring because I saw so many of my experiences echoed by other Neurospicy people and then finally remember I quit the rat race. So maybe don't take my advice You know because I was successful for a time but ultimately I was like I'm done So like my best advice is get out if you can, I guess, but we'll try it. We'll try and stay in the container of a regular job. So my number one rule that I came up with many years ago, this is before I fully realized that I was narrow spicy. I had already taken a proctored intelligence test so that I knew that I was very high on the on the right tail of The bell curve on intelligence, but it wasn't aware of the rest of it So this is be good So to be good means to be above average In skills abilities and so on it does not mean to work harder than everyone else, it means to work smarter. Or if you can, be capable of things that no one else can do. And then to be reliable just means to perform consistently, whether it's showing up on time, to regularly produce good results, otherwise to be dependable and trustworthy. And finally, be likable. The more people like you, the better. Humans are emotional. That's all there is to it. My rule is that I always tell people is you need at least two of these. If you're good and likable, people will give you a pass on reliability. If you're reliable and likable, it doesn't matter if you're that good. Like my dog, sweetest dog ever, dumb as a brick. But he's very consistent, he's always there, he's very sweet, very likable. So reliable and likable, dumb as a brick. Gets confused at the simplest things. Now, ideally you have all three. So what I would recommend is that you invest skill points in all three of these categories if you can, but you can also double down on two of them if that's all you got. So earlier in my career, I focused entirely on being good and reliable because I was like, I don't like most people and most people don't like me because I'm weird. So I just focused on, let me have exceptional skills and let me be the most consistent performer on the team. That carried me to a six-figure career. After a while, once I ended up in the right place and I was practicing and healing and learning about who I am, I actually became more likable over time. And so once you get to all three, that's when you're in really good shape. So this system is super simple. There's a lot to learn and unpack, but good, reliable, likeable, pick at least two. All right. So say no early and often. So this is going to be paradoxical to many people, whether or not you're narrow-spicy. Saying no actually raises your social value. The reason is because it programs into other people's minds, oh, this person is in a doormat. I can't just yank them around. They have enough confidence to tell me no. It's a completely unconscious reaction, but you tell someone no once and they are less likely to push on boundaries again, and they're like, okay, well, it didn't work last time and their emotional brain is like, okay, well, I guess I'm not going to try that again. Also being scarce raises your perceived value. If you tell people, sorry, I'm busy, I can't do that, it says like, oh wow, whatever this guy's got going on, they're clearly valuable, so I have to be grateful for the time that they give me. And this is also echoed, so if you watch my other videos, this is also echoed particularly in leadership for Taoism. If you ever notice that managers and bosses are less available, sometimes that's deliberate. Sometimes they're being deliberately mysterious. And some of them take it too far, but there is also something about being busier, being more important, and so on, that makes you less available or that you have to say no more often. There's lots and lots and lots of research about boundaries, about how to do it, when, why, and why it works. Just go to Harvard Business Review, hbr.org, and search for say no in their little search bar. You'll get like hundreds of articles and podcasts about saying no. Another thing to remember is that no is a complete sentence. You never have to justify it. If someone says, hey, I want you to come in on the weekend, about saying no. Another thing to remember is that no is a complete sentence. You never have to justify it. If someone says, hey, I want you to come in on the weekend, you just say no and walk away. If someone says like, hey, I need you to take on this other project, no. It's that simple, no, I'm not going to. And if people don't respect that, leave. It's that simple. I have had to tell people like if you do not respect my no, I am gone. End of story. And people will get that because you know either they won't get it and they'll continue pressing and you leave, right? You have to be willing to back up that threat or they'll get it and they'll respect you more. So one thing that I wanted to point out about autistic people, neurospicy people, is that like neurospiciness, which runs in families, bad boundaries also run in families. So here's a pattern that I noticed, and I have no idea how common this pattern is, but us neurospicy people, we didn't just fall out of the sky. We came from neurospicy parents or parents that have the ingredients of neurospiciness. Some of us are more neurospicy than our fall out of the sky. We came from neuro-spicy parents or parents that have the ingredients of neuro-spiciness. Some of us are more neuro-spicy than our parents, but in many cases our parents were similarly mistreated by society and their own parents and their boundaries were not respected and they taught us not to expect boundaries and not to respect boundaries. And so learning to say no can feel incredibly dangerous. Why? Because your family might not have respected no. And honestly this is a big reason that I don't spend much time with most of my family of origin is because like they didn't treat me right. Like you know and some of that is just I was wait I was I got I got like all the neuro spiciness. They knew just I was way, I got all the neuro-spiciness. They knew that I was different from a very young age and they just didn't know what to do with me. But at a certain point, some of them also were very controlling or whatever and I was just like, no, I'm not going to deal with you people. So bad boundaries, not respecting, no, this runs in families as does neuro-spiciness. And I think in some cases that is not an accident and it really sucks. So while I have some critical things to say of my family and other families that I've noticed, it sucks because our parents and our grandparents, they had to cope with being different without the benefit of the knowledge that we have today. So they did the best that they could. So some empathy, but also boundaries. And then finally, like I said, leave workplaces that don't respect boundaries. Block people that don't respect boundaries. I block people all the time on YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, all of my online presence that I still have. I use that block button all the time. I have people reaching out to me trying to sell me stuff, I will give them one polite no, and if they persist, if they don't accept no for an answer, I block them. And I actually saw, there was a post, this was months ago on LinkedIn, where someone's like, it was a sales dude who was like super proud of no just means try harder and no is is is blah blah blah and I'm like dude like learn about consent if someone says no move on and so like I added that comment and then blocked like no no is a complete sentence it is also a final answer if someone won't respect my no I'm never gonna buy something from them so give up, get off my soapbox. Look for diversity. Avoid workplaces that over-represent any single demographic. I don't care what demographic it is. If you walk into a workplace and it is all people of one color, one gender, one race, one religion, walk right back out. The reason is because that demonstrates that they have a very low tolerance or understanding for any kind of diversity, including of thought, of expertise, of behavior. The most backwards place that I ever worked was 90% one demographic. Guess which one? And it was incredibly backwards. And I'm also convinced that they would have been 100% one demographic if they could if not for diversity laws that required them to hire women and minorities and oh, by the way The one minority that I was aware of in the company was like relegated to like the most distant field office, right? So that so that the the main Office never had to see him and I'm like, this is disgusting. But so it has less to do with like, you know, purity or whatever, and it has to do with, we only want people who think like us. We only want people who are intelligent as us, because they also don't like people, monolithic demographic places like that. They don't like any kind of difference. They don't like any kind of exceptionalism one way or the other. Now, that being said, diversity is not a guarantee that it is going to be a better workplace. The reason is because some workplaces do diversity just because it is in vogue lately. Because the CEO read in Forbes or Fortune or Harvard Business Review, diversity is good. And so he was like, oh yeah, diversity is good. So they call up HR and say, we're going to do diversity now. And it's very performative. It's virtue signaling. And it's just so that they can hit some social KPI or whatever and also to get tax breaks. So this is one of the worst things is if you see a company that goes on like we value disability and diversity and we want to hire autistic people or disabled veterans, in some cases, and this is very cynical of me, in some cases that is just tokenism. They're not actually going to make any substantive cultural changes to actually embrace diversity. They're just trying to graft on like, look, we did a diversity by hiring a disabled person. So avoid places that virtue signal too. Look for what you might call true diversity, which is places that very deliberately include multiple kinds of people and invite lots of kinds of thought. And my last workplace, it was weird kinds of people and invite lots of kinds of thought. My last workplace, it was weird because some business units did it really well and other business units didn't. Also keep in mind that especially as companies get larger, you can have these silos where you might have good culture in one silo and awful culture in another. Like, you know, oh the legal department or oh the construction department or oh, whatever, you know, there can be interdepartmental vast differences between departments. So yeah, diversity generally a good thing. If you don't see diversity, walk away. And if you do see diversity, make sure that it's not just virtue signaling. Okay, next tip, window of tolerance. So window of tolerance is a term that comes from, I think it actually comes from PTSD research. Not sure where it actually originated, but it's a very useful term. It actually has a lot broader implications. And so the idea is there is a minimum threshold of stimulation that you need, so that's hypoarousal. So if you're bored, like that's hypoarousal is basically a term for bored, but there's a lot more neurological implications around that. And basically what happens is your brain kind of spins down into this neutral state, which is itself very, very, very unpleasant. It's basically a form of torture, which a lot of office jobs, especially for those of us that are neuro-spicy and on the more high-energy end, 99% of people do not go at our pace. And that can be painful. That's honestly why I struggled in school so much is because public education goes at the pace of the slowest students. And if you are 10 times faster than the slowest student, you're bored out of your mind all the time. So that's hypoarousal. Hyperarousal is if there's too much going on. So open office plans where there's lots of people, lots of conversation, lots of noise, the lights are incredibly bright. Good Lord, who designed open office plans? Like, I would have to wear a hat every day because the lights were so glaring. Like, you see my room, like, I've got one ceiling light and then one lamp, and it's like nice and subdued and warm, and it's like, this is basic human physiology. We don't do, anyways, sorry, getting off my soapbox. Hypoarousal, hyperarousal,al stay between those and that is your window of tolerance now That being said you can widen your window of tolerance So sleep diet and exercise are the most important things for widening your window of tolerance There's other things that you can do. So for instance meditation, I just learned this yesterday of tolerance. There's other things that you can do, so for instance meditation. I just learned this yesterday. Meditation can actually change the connectivity of your amygdala, which is one of the things that mediates your window of tolerance, one of the primary brain structures. So meditation can do that, but also music and sensory tools and other stuff can also influence that. So I ended up getting myself amped up every day, excuse me, in order to stay kind of activated. This was when I was in really bad shape and so I would be in a state of hypoarousal or shutdown almost every day. And so what I would do is I'd listen to some loud, good music to get myself worked up and activated. Turns out I was getting myself into a state of hyper arousal every day. So that probably speaks to why I'm having to undo that work. So avoid triggers if you can, avoid getting yourself amped up. Focus on being chill if you can. And then also learn to protect your window. That's why I picked this graphic where you got bars over the window. Your window is your window. Everyone has limits. It's just a matter of how big your window is and how fragile it is. So avoid the people, situations, tasks, etc. that force you out of your window zone. That being said, if you've got a small fragile window, don't use that as an excuse to never grow. You still need to stretch yourself, but don't let other people force it on you. Does that make sense? You are in control of your window. Don't let other people control your window. But if you've got a little window, you can work on it. Okay, I think you get the idea. Less is more. This is a universal rule of thumb. I've got two examples, but remember this mantra, less is more, less is more. In so many cases in work, and I'll repeat this in a few later slides, less is more. So one, never write long emails. Just don't. The primary exception in my experience is unless you're a subject matter expert and people really need a thorough explanation. So, for instance, at my day job, before I left, I was like the best person in the company for virtualization. And because virtualization is a big mysterious black box to people, I would get commented, I would get roped in on projects, on emergency calls, all kinds of stuff. And people would be like, what do we do, how does it work? And they're like, Dave, save us. And so what I would see is if there's debate going back and forth, I would like, okay, what's the debate, what's the issue? I would present evidence, I would write a really structured email, kind of like, almost like a business case or a scientific article saying, here's the facts, here's how it works, here's why, here's how you might think it works, but here's the caveat, here's why it's wrong, here's the solution, here's my recommendation, here's my past experience. Nine times out of 10, that would stop the panic in its tracks. And people are like, sometimes they wouldn't respond at all, and other times they're like, thanks Dave, I get it, okay, let's move on. So those are the only cases that I found that a long email is actually called for. One thing that I learned, so I used to work with military guys, I try and avoid military guys right now because especially leaders in the military, they bring the military mindset to the workplace and they say like, you know, I say jump, you say how high. Basically if someone says, we like hiring military people, it's because they like being able to mete out arbitrary abuse. So I avoid military workplaces like the plague. Now that being said, there are lots of good ideas that come out of the military. One of those is bluff, bottom line up front. So if you struggle with communication, the rule of thumb that I found is try and put the entire message in the subject line. Say like, this is what I need, this is like, either ask a question or state a fact in the subject line. If someone only looks at the subject line, they should at least get 50% to 90% of what you need them to know. Think of if you write an email to the fire department, like, building 401 on West Street is on fire, right? You state a fact. Or if you have a question, like, you know, where is the lunch line? So one thing that I hate above all else is really generic subject lines. And you see this on subreddit where it's like, question, that is not a good subject line for a email or a Reddit post or whatever. You should get as much information as possible in the subject line and let that do most of the work. If you need to add some clarification, that's fine. If you ever see someone who says like, you know, question is title or you know, whatever, like that's actually not a bad model because then all you're doing is starting a conversation. Another thing is use chat GPT and other tools to help you write diplomatic emails. On my other channel, I did a fine-tuning project to write perfect emails, but now you can just use ChatGPT and other things like, hey, I have this problem, can you write a diplomatic email? And use that word diplomatic. Be diplomatic as diplomatic as possible. It might still not work, but it's going to get you better results than being angry or whatever. And then the second thing on less is more is leave emotions at home. And again, I have a caveat here. And the reason is because neurotypical people, some of them only understand emotions. They don't get logic. And it's really weird. Like I remember, you know, if you ever watch Star Trek and you see like the Vulcans that are logical, like to some people Vulcans seem alien because they use logic, because they put logic first. And I'm just like that doesn't seem that alien to me. Turns out like 60 plus percent of people in the world, maybe 75 percent of the people of the world, really struggle with logic and they only understand emotions. And what's even weirder to me is that not only are emotions front and center to most people, they're unconscious of how much their emotions control them. It's like they're just tossed in a river of emotions and they're just along for the ride and they don't even realize it. So I'm like, how do tippies function? Like, if you don't have access to logic and you don't have access to the information about why your emotions are doing certain things, how do you function in the world? So anyways, this is one of the reasons that neurotypicals and neurospicy people are different and we sometimes don't see eye to eye. So with all that being said, a really simple statement like, I am scared or I am angry or I am tired, a lot of teepees will get that. Like that tells them so much more than like logicing at them and saying like, hey, this this and this happened and I want this this, this, and this, and other thing to happen. And they can't read between the lines that like, you're fed up about something. Like all like you want to, like, again, bottom line up front, you state the problem. I am too tired to deal with this. Or, you know, and this goes back to the boundaries thing. Many of us were taught that our needs don't matter. And so we're not used to saying like, I'm tired, I'm angry, I'm hurt, and having that be respected. If you work in an environment where your emotional needs or physical needs are not respected, quit. Like that's all I can say. That being said, you can also practice stating your needs. It is okay to have needs. And so when I say less is more, like if you just say I'm angry, like I'm angry at you right now. Like it feels dangerous to say that, but a lot of tippies respond really well to that. I still don't get it. If you can tell someone you did this, this, and this wrong, you should have done it this way, you can use logic, they don't get it, that makes them angry. Right? It's like, but you're the one that messed up. So anyways, this is part of the emotional Morse code that tippies use. And here's the thing, this is not a disorder, because talking like this with other neuro-spicy people works. It is a disconnect between spiciness and tippies. Right? We can communicate with each other this way, using logic, we'll understand the implications, but, and then tippies of course can use purely emotional communication with each other, and that works. So when we're in our own groups, it works, but yeah, anyways, I'm starting to repeat myself. I hope that makes sense. Okay, another rule of thumb. Don't scare the tippies. I have a story. So back when I was working at a tech giant, this was when I got really good at scripting and automation. And I got really good at it. And so the architect on our team came over one day and he's like, Dave, we've got this problem. I know you like scripting. You're really good at automation. Like, how do you think we should handle this? And we were talking through it and I was getting more and more excited. And then I started talking at my normal speed, which is twice as fast as most people. And like, I was getting more energetic and animated and I'm like, oh yes, we can totally solve this problem. And then by the end of the conversation, the architect is just like leaning back wide-eyed and then he just turns away and walks away. And ever since that day, he made my life hell. He started giving me trivial work, he started throwing me under the bus, he started blaming me for everything. And I was like, after working with him for like two years, suddenly I was public enemy number one. And it took me many years to understand why. The reason is because some neurotypicals perceive us as alien or even dangerous. When he saw the true like raw power of my intellect or whatever, he had an emotional reaction. And there are five general emotional reactions that people have to us NeuroSpicy people. One is fear. So fear is like, I don't understand this person. This person might kill me, right? Like I don't understand why they think that just because someone is different they might shoot them or whatever. Another is rage, which is this person needs to be punished for being different. This is where bullying comes from, is anything that's different deserves punishment. Again I don't get it, like you know we've been different our whole lives and we're not trying to punish everyone. So again a lot of tippies are just absolutely controlled by their like really primitive impulses Another one is awe and I when I say awe I mean like like whoa How did you do that? and this is why we like shows like Sherlock and Doctor Who is Some people really like that sensation of being in the presence of someone who is has an alien intellect Or alien way of looking at the world. Another is shame So one of the reactions that people at the world. Another is shame. So one of the reactions that people have to neuro spiciness is shame. It's like, wow, you can do things that I can't. You can do things that I never will. Now I feel bad about myself and I hate you for it. And so then they also might use shame as a reason to start punishing you or alienating you. And then finally indifference. I had a another job where I brought, you know And then finally, indifference. I had another job where I brought the full power of my abilities to make things better. And I remember I got at my first year-end review, you're supposed to rate yourself, and I said, exceeded expectations. And my boss was like, well, no, this is what we're paying you to do. So I changed it to meets expectations. And I was like, you don't have the first frigging clue what I have done for you. That guy was an idiot. I don't. Yeah. So, but, you know, indifference is another is another response. And honestly, between those, like indifference, indifference is probably the best, followed by awe. One problem with awe, you might think that that's good, one problem is that, especially at my last job, I built up a reputation, and I didn't even try and do this, I had a reputation for being amazing. Everyone up to the C-suite knew my name and sometimes asked for me by name because they knew that I could solve problems. Well, the thing is, is your reputation spreads through an organization and other people hear, oh wow, Dave's really good. And that, that like generates a sense of shame in them by proxy. And so then I started getting targeted by bullying for other people and then HR wouldn't do anything. So I quit. So yeah, humans love bullying. If you scare the tippies, you very well could start receiving bullying. So here's the problem is most people are fine. Like 90% of people will never bully, right? But the 10% who do feel so righteously justified in punishing you for being different and then for whatever reason because most people are powered by their emotions if someone sees that someone feels very righteous, very self-righteous and you're different and you need to be punished, a lot of tippies won't stand up to it. I don't get that. And again, like I've said, most tippies seem to be unconscious to how much their emotions control them, which is weird to us because like we've had to control our emotions, right? And I know that there are certain demographics that are also used to this. So anyways, we might try logicing at them like this is why you're wrong or this is why you hurt me. That never works. So like again, if you get in that situation, my recommendation is just leave. Alright, so some social tips. And I picked Sir Anthony Hopkins here because he is NeuroSp spicy, but he's also a good actor. And so what he explained was that he just very meticulously studied and practiced all the different skills that go into acting. And that forms the core of my recommendation for how to get by socially. So tip number one is people love talking about themselves. Get good at asking questions. I know that a lot of us have our special interests. Nobody cares about our special interests. I had a text conversation with a friend like 15 years ago and I was complaining that nobody wants to talk about what I want to talk about and she's like well you just have to talk about what other people want to talk about and I was angry at the time I was like that's not fair I am tired of not having anyone interested in my same interest. Turns out special interest so now I know how to find special interest groups but people like talking about themselves. And so get really good at asking questions. If someone, like they'll give you little clues, and my fiance actually taught me this, if someone expresses an opinion or a belief about something, ask about that. Wait, where did that come from? What's the history on that? And this will solve 90% of your social problems, I promise, because people love talking about themselves. And a very small minority will even catch themselves or realize that they're talking about themselves for 15 minutes straight. They'll just like you. They're like, oh, cool. I like talking to Dave because he asks me questions about myself. Again, it's completely unconscious on the part of most neurotypicals. You push the button, you say, I'm going to ask a question about you, and then they like you more. It's like, do you ever play Skyrim or the Bethesda games? I remember I was playing one and I was just like, oh, here's an interesting character. And so I kept using the dialogue wheel to ask them questions because I was curious. And then by the end, he's like, oh, thanks friend. And I'm like, friend, what the hell? But that's actually how a lot of people work. You just spam the question button and they end up liking you more. Now, that being said, one thing that I noticed is that if you feel awkward, you might assume that it's you who has the bad social skills. And this is something that I've learned in like the last year is actually a lot of people have bad social skills and they don't know how to respond. And I'm like, oh, this is actually a you problem. And so then if you do sense some tension or awkwardness, it might be because you're HSP and you actually have an overly sensitive sense of empathy, which means they're projecting their awkwardness onto you, but you might not be able to realize that you're just sensing the general awkwardness of the interaction. So don't assume that it's you who has the bad social skills. It might be. It kind of doesn't matter either way. And one thing you can do is you can address the awkwardness. Be like, hmm, so this conversation isn't going the way that I thought it was and often moving the Overton window like that gives people permission to laugh at it and be like let's try that again. Practice telling one or two stories. So I already told a story earlier another one of my go-to stories is about when I first started working on the core objective functions and I taught GPT-2 to reduce suffering and GPT-2 said we should euthanize all people with chronic pain in order to reduce suffering and I was like, well, okay, it's not exactly what I meant. Another thing, so once you have a couple stories that you've practiced that you can tell, don't just pull them out at any time. It's really difficult to say like when it is appropriate to bring out a story. If you practice, you might figure it out, but stories aren't necessary. Like I said, people love talking about themselves. This will solve 90% of your problems. Now, for many of us NeuroSpicy people, prosody, which is talking like, you know, as I'm talking with a little bit of tone and inflection and changes, this makes a much bigger difference than you might think. For some people, a flat affect or monotonous tone can actually be endearing. Some people lean into it, right? Like, look at how popular the Wednesday Addams Show was. I actually dated a girl once who, like, had almost that exact demeanor. And it was really endearing. And then there's a what was her name? The actress is Aubrey Plaza from Parks and Rec. She was like that too, right? Just very flat affect, very like cynical and a cerebric sense of humor. So you don't necessarily need prosody, but it can help. And it's also something that you can practice. I have not always been able to speak like this. And again, less is more. So I said that earlier. If you're a good listener and that's all that you can do, that goes a long ways. A lot of people love people who are just good listeners. And then finally, imitate good behavior. Copy people. This is what Anthony Hopkins did and look at what it did for his career. Fake it till you make it. This actually works. Shamelessly copy and mirror people. Most people aren't conscious of the fact that you're doing it. They're just like, oh, okay, you're doing a thing. And there's actually this funny phenomenon where we are kind of like chameleons. And if we spend a day with a certain social group we will by the end of the day like have unconsciously or consciously copied a lot of their mannerisms and a lot of their you know verbal tics or whatever even down to copying their tone or their inflection. So anyways those are some social tips. It all takes practice and that's one that's that's really the key thing that I wanted to drive home is that you do have like everyone has limitations as to what they can and cannot do so you can lean into the things that you are good at and practice the things that you are not as good at. Now another question, should you disclose? This question comes up a lot. It was one of the ones in the comment and I've seen plenty of other YouTube videos on it. And so here's my take. People are going to know that you're different no matter what. At one of my first jobs, the job was going to get shut down because of the pandemic, or not pandemic, because of the Great Recession. So this was back in like 2007, 2008. And the owner of the company like took us all out to lunch and he said nice things. He's like, Dave, you're an odd bird, but you're really good. And I'm like, I don't know what to do with this information. I was way weirder back then. So anyways, point being is people are gonna know that you're different. People are gonna know that you're weird. Nothing you can do about that. Don't try and fully mask it. That being said, what you can do is you can lampshade it. So lampshading comes from the writing world, which is where you just address something that seems off. You say you just acknowledge, this is a thing that's happening. Yes, it's weird. Let's move on. And rather than saying that you're autistic because there's so much stigma around autism and most people don't know how to deal with it, if you say that you're like, oh, I think I'm ADHD, people have a much better model for that. Like if you interrupt people or you're a little bit weird or you have eccentric interests, I'm ADHD. They're like, oh, I get it. My cousin's ADHD. They're cool. Or you say you're a big introvert. I remember I was at another one of my many jobs and I heard a couple ladies talking over by the coffee machine and she's like, oh, I think I just get more introverted over time. And that can be like a dog whistle for saying like, I'm autistic and I just can't deal with people anymore. So say that you're introverted, say that you have ADHD, something like that. And the thing is, is that's not necessarily a lie. It's just not the whole picture, right? But the problem is that there is so much stigma around autism that people are like, oh, you're autistic so I'm just going to keep my distance. But it's like, I'm ADHD or I'm an introverted. People get that. So if you do want to disclose, distance, but it's like I'm ADHD or I'm an introvert. People get that. So if you do want to disclose, that is one possible way to do it. And again, like I'm saying, I'm not saying lie. I'm just saying just curate the information that you give with your audience in mind. And also, if you don't have a formal diagnosis, it doesn't matter in 99% of cases from an HR or legal standpoint. If companies are not legally required to give you accommodations, they won't. It's that simple. Because HR departments, all they care about is protecting the company and protecting the bottom line. And so if they determine that like, oh, well, there's no tax benefit for us and there's no legal exposure, we're not going to do anything. That being said, tolerance, awareness, and acceptance are on the rise, but that's more from a social perspective than a mechanistic HR or legal perspective. And finally, radical self-acceptance. Be weird and own it. If you ever see someone at like, you know, the office that is just different and they don't seem bothered by it, like, you know, people admire Be weird and own it. If you ever see someone in the office that is just different and they don't seem bothered by it, like, you know, people admire confidence. And also, like, you have no reason to be ashamed for being different. One, you didn't choose it. It's not a choice. And two, it's not that bad. It's only bad in the eyes of certain people, and those people are wrong. It's that simple. Solitude. Okay, so this one is, again, this is from my own perspective and so categorically, I will say that those of us that are different, like, I don't really see much point in trying to integrate and trying to pretend to be the same. So seek out remote and flex work. So if you're not familiar with the term, look up digital nomad. Basically this means working from your phone or laptop or a rent an Airbnb somewhere around the world. People understand the desire for remote and flex work and digital nomadism a lot more today than they used to and So this can give you a way to protect your solitude I've literally had worked entire days while going out for walks There was one one day that I walked I think I probably walked about 15 miles and I took about three or four meetings while I was on the walk. I Responded to some emails. I responded to some Teams messages, and I did my entire day of work, like just while out and about, walking on the trails. And that's fine. Obviously, not all jobs you can do this, but I just wanna say that like, it is a thing that you can do. Like it is hypothetically possible, depending on what your job is. Bow out of social engagements if needed. So I had to get good at going to lunches because I was so important and central and so like I had to meet with vendors, I had to meet with stakeholders, and so on and so forth, and they all want to go out to lunch. I don't get that, like taking people out to lunch, I think that should just go away because eating is freaking awkward, right? Like, hey, I'm going to stare at you while you're chewing and then we're going to talk about things that don't really matter. Anyways, these are just social bonding rituals that neurotypical people like. So do it if you need to, but also you can bow out of it. And finally, one thing that might help is if you mentally reframe social outings as social practice, where you just say, I'm gonna try an experiment. I'm gonna try this. That actually really helps because it takes the pressure off. It's no longer a performance. It's no longer a social performance. It is now social practice. People will get the message eventually if you prefer solitude. If you stop accepting invitations, the invitations will blessedly stop coming. This also applies to friends and family. So like, I don't get invited to Thanksgiving or Christmas anymore. Why? Because I never showed up anyways. So like, hey, they got the message. It also applies to friends. So like, this is a good and bad thing. And that is like, okay, if you kind of drop off the radar, your friends will stop reaching out to you. So then it is incumbent upon you to reach out to your friends to reinitiate. Usually they're pretty receptive, so just keep that in mind that if you don't show up, the invitations stop. And then finally, you might experience a sense of guilt or shame over solitude, and this is because our society over emphasizes the importance or the value of being popular and extroverted. And so because of that you have been programmed to feel shame if you spend too much time alone, because it's not desirable. It means that you're weird, it means that you're a shut-in or whatever. And so my recommendation there is like just spend some time unpacking that and being like actually no, this is like actually how I want to live. I usually do about one or two social outings a week and beyond that I spend most of my time by myself. There's a YouTuber named Savannah Brown, who is, I adore her, and she has a video, it's like forming, what was it, the title is like, Forming Authentic Human Connections, sounds fake but okay. So anyways, she's great, and she talks about the same things and her journey has been partially self-learning and self-acceptance, So I definitely recommend her. Okay, so structures, rules, and goals. We, we meaning NeuroSpicy people, it seems to be true of almost all of us. And I could be wrong, but I think that we all do really well with rules. Now, create rules if they're not there, find them or derive them if they are there, and make rules for yourself. So, everything in the universe follows rules. Even if the rules are mysterious, the rules are there, it's just a matter of discovering them, unpacking them, and so on. And if the rules, if there are no rules, if it is pure chaos, then you can make rules This is actually why I got really good at hosting and conducting meetings Because meetings are like a bunch of people get together in a room and then talk randomly until something happens And I'm like, this is a waste of time So one of the rules of thumb that I created is do not attend a meeting without a very explicit agenda I actually had someone reach out to me Regarding my startup who wanted to have an unstructured coffee date and I said, what's your agenda? He's like, no agenda. And I'm like, every human has an agenda. And so I was like, no thanks, blocked him. If someone thinks that they have no agenda, that just means that they're not conscious of their motivations. Every meeting has to happen for a purpose. Create rules, create structure, create an agenda. Now, that being said, don't go overboard with rules. I have noticed this phenomenon, and I call it rule stacking, where basically people compensate just by adding more and more rules until they're keeping track of dozens or hundreds of rules. Don't do that, because then you're going to twist yourself into logical pretzels and you're not gonna be able to abide by all rules. So what I do is I simplify rules. So I always try and distill everything down to three rules or principles, if possible. It's not always possible. Like at the beginning of the video, where I said you gotta be good, likable, and reliable, right, those are three rules, general principles. Some people get lost with very, very specific rules, like if this one exact situation, then do this other exact thing. If you need that, that can be fine, but personally, I prefer more general principles rather than hyper-specific rules. If you're in technology, it's like creating 100,000 rules for a firewall. Don't do that. That's too much to keep track of. Now, last thing that I want to point out, your rules are your rules. Remember that your rules don't apply to anyone else unless they have agreed to them. This is really weird, and it's especially because the rules that make sense to me, I feel like they should make sense to everyone else. Like be fair. Fairness is one of my cardinal rules. If someone is not fair to me, I don't want to talk to them ever. I don't even want to work with them. It's like, you're not a fair person, go away. I don't understand why the rest of the world doesn't operate by this rule, so I have to realize this is my rule. And then social rules or work rules are social rules and work rules, and you don't necessarily get to choose those. So the rule of thumb here is different sets of rules for different contexts. That being said, you can literally write them down. Like, oh, I just discovered a new rule. Write it down somewhere. Like, create a log or a constitution of rules, but keep in mind the context as to where and when those rules apply. And again, don't get carried away if you have a list of hundreds of rules, try and simplify it. Wait, was that it? Oh, I guess that was it. Okay, so thanks for watching. I hope this was helpful. Yeah, and... Okay, I'm just gonna stop talking, because that's it. because that's it.", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 1.0], "text": " Morning, everybody."}, {"timestamp": [1.0, 3.0], "text": " David Shapiro here with a video."}, {"timestamp": [3.0, 8.0], "text": " Also, you might have noticed the little window in the top left or right, I don't remember,"}, {"timestamp": [8.0, 9.0], "text": " is bigger."}, {"timestamp": [9.0, 10.84], "text": " I got an idea."}, {"timestamp": [10.84, 14.36], "text": " Someone suggested making it bigger because I'm very expressive and you want to see my"}, {"timestamp": [14.36, 15.36], "text": " face more."}, {"timestamp": [15.36, 16.36], "text": " I don't know."}, {"timestamp": [16.36, 17.36], "text": " Let me know if it works for you."}, {"timestamp": [17.36, 22.78], "text": " Anyways, today's video is career tips for low-needs autistic adults."}, {"timestamp": [22.78, 26.16], "text": " This was an idea that popped up from several places"}, {"timestamp": [26.16, 27.4], "text": " and I posted all about it"}, {"timestamp": [27.4, 30.46], "text": " and I got some good questions and tips."}, {"timestamp": [30.46, 32.82], "text": " And plus, yeah, whatever."}, {"timestamp": [34.84, 37.32], "text": " There's some disclaimers, put it that way."}, {"timestamp": [37.32, 38.84], "text": " So everyone is different."}, {"timestamp": [38.84, 40.68], "text": " So some of this,"}, {"timestamp": [40.68, 43.64], "text": " or this is mostly coming from my own personal experience,"}, {"timestamp": [43.64, 49.3], "text": " plus some of the stuff that I've read in books and online, and some stuff that various friends have told"}, {"timestamp": [49.3, 50.3], "text": " me."}, {"timestamp": [50.3, 55.52], "text": " So, disclaimer number one, none of this should be construed as actual legal advice."}, {"timestamp": [55.52, 58.56], "text": " I recommend that you contact an attorney if you ever have any questions."}, {"timestamp": [58.56, 64.24], "text": " Yes, they are expensive, but they are there to help you, and because attorneys are very"}, {"timestamp": [64.24, 65.68], "text": " rule-based people,"}, {"timestamp": [65.68, 67.72], "text": " I actually have a pretty easy time communicating with them."}, {"timestamp": [67.72, 71.16], "text": " It's just a matter of what rules they're operating by."}, {"timestamp": [71.16, 73.68], "text": " Some people have had drastically different experiences"}, {"timestamp": [73.68, 76.94], "text": " from me, so some of the stuff that I say may not apply"}, {"timestamp": [76.94, 80.44], "text": " or might even be the opposite of your experience."}, {"timestamp": [80.44, 82.64], "text": " That being said, some people have had similar experiences."}, {"timestamp": [82.64, 90.56], "text": " I really found Unmasking Autism by Devon price to be really reassuring because I saw so many of my experiences echoed by other"}, {"timestamp": [91.0, 97.44], "text": " Neurospicy people and then finally remember I quit the rat race.
