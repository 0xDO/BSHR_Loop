{"text": " Good morning, everybody. David Shapiro here with another video. This is going to be a comprehensive deep dive based on my experience Both my professional experience before AI and my consulting experience now that I am an AI specialist So today's topic is knowledge management Specifically when vector search alone is not enough So if you're watching this video video I'm imagining that these are some of the problems you're facing. You've built a chatbot or some other similar generative AI tool probably with the chat GPT API or similar API. It can do some stuff. You've cut your teeth, you've got your feet wet on this technology, it can do some things very well but but you're working on figuring out how to steer these things. You even have some integrations, maybe you've figured out how to have dynamically composed prompts, you've done search augmentation, and then maybe you're even using API calls and that sort of thing. But you're finding really profound limitations because on its own, operating in a vacuum these chat bots and other tools they're really kind of useless because they don't have the context of the rest of your organization or other context of the of whatever task or pipeline that it's in and that sort of thing. So you've got constraints on window size. How do you keep it from hallucinating? How do you keep it grounded? And so basically now you have a sad little lost robot and you need to figure out how to teach it to get to the next level. So here's a little bit about me. I was an enterprise IT infrastructure engineer for about 15 years. For those of you that are not familiar with IT infrastructure, we work with basically everyone. Network security, database, software, enterprise architects. We have to have meetings with, if you've got, you know, brick and mortar stores, we help with that. We help with the data center. Pretty much everything. My focus was on automation, cloud, and virtualization. Now I consult on AI products and strategy on top of, of course, my YouTube channel. And for those of you that are new, actually how my channel got started was a lot of coding tutorials which if you go to the homepage of my YouTube channel, I've got it all in a list. I've got like 50 or so coding tutorials still out there. Now the reason that I made this video is because I had like three or four clients in a row basically ask the same or very similar questions. And so when that happens I know that this is resonating. And then finally I married a librarian and so a lot of what we talk about it has to do with data and information, storage, retrieval, curation, that sort of stuff. So I'm bringing a tremendous amount of different disciplines and experience in order to bring you this video. So here's before this is the last slide before we get started. I promise we're about to get in there. But you need to know what kind of information I'm going to give you and how you need to use it. So right up next, I'm going to give you a lot of concepts. So I understand that many of you watching are either CEOs, directors, managers, developers. Many of you probably don't know the first thing about librarianship or information science. Many of you probably don't know the first thing about philosophy and epistemics, which you might be thinking, why is that even relevant? You will see. And then some of you, many of you, probably are from computer science and information technology. So I'll be talking with you, many of you probably are from computer science and information technology. So I'll be talking with you, basically translating all this into your language. Or if you're a business leader, you might not know any of these disciplines. Now your mission, should you choose to accept it, you got to wrap your head around these concepts. You're probably going to need to watch this video several times. You might need to have chat GPT or clod or perplexity open on the side so you can jot down concepts to follow up on But basically we're going to push you towards being a transdisciplinary AI product design manager and strategist So it'll take you a little while to integrate these ideas and to synthesize something new So like I said, you probably want to download the slide deck to synthesize something new. So like I said, you probably want to download the slide deck. The slide decks are all available on my GitHub, link in the description. You can also sign up on my Patreon. I do consultation at any given time. I have about 20 clients. And so I'm happy to jump on a call with you to explain these concepts more specifically. In the past, so this is for all you people that heard me in the past say that I don't sign NDAs, I've actually contacted a lawyer friend and we're getting a consultation NDA set up. So I know that that has been a reason that many people have hesitated. So in the next week or two, I'll have an official NDA that I can sign that will protect both of our interests, because obviously I need to keep consulting with clients and I need to make sure that I don't transfer any of my personal IP while also protecting your IP. Okay, now we've laid all the groundwork. Let's get on to the show. Also, I apologize if the microphone phases in and out of existence. I'm trying to figure out how to mask that off. But yeah, so I do have a proper green screen behind me, which is why I can gesture and the background doesn't glitch in and out of existence. All right, sorry. Tangent. Now for the concepts and solutions. There's about 10 or 15 slides here. So buckle in and let's go through these. The first concept you need to know is data ontologies. Now I'm not going to read all of these per se. You can pause the video and read them, but mostly I'm just gonna tell you like, okay, when I say data ontology, what do I mean? Ontology is the philosophical or epistemic discipline of state of being. What does something actually exist as? And so this comes from database theory, it also comes from philosophy and epistemics, which is basically, okay, if you had to characterize data and information in a vacuum or scientifically, this is what you would call your ontologies. So if you've got any database administrators or database engineers in your team, you can talk with them more about, like, what is a data ontology and how do you understand data. Because here's the thing is, many people who are new to generative AI, they're thinking in terms of text and qualitative data, whereas you might be familiar with thinking in terms of quantitative data and relational databases. But data is data. And particularly your data engineers, your data automation specialists, your data analysts, they're gonna be able to understand and help you understand what ontologies are. So for instance, if you work with a lot of squishy text data like user comments or KB articles or stuff, that is still data, it is not relational mathematical data. And I know that there are gonna be some purists out there who say, well, if it's not math, it's not data, but that's not really how the world works. So if you talk to librarians, too, we'll love to talk to you about the different kinds of data and how to categorize them. All right, next up is you need to be familiar with the concepts of reconciliation and validation. So reconciliation often is a process that's more used in the finance side of your business. And so you reconcile spreadsheets, you reconcile numbers. But reconciliation applies to literally every discipline that has to deal with data, where you've got data coming from different sources, with different levels of validation, different levels of trustworthiness. So for instance, one of the products that my wife works on, I forgot to mention, she went from librarianship to a data product owner, so like her experience is also directly relevant. So one of the products that she works on, they have sources of information that come from vendors, but some of the information is wrong, and it is hilariously wrong. And so they have to basically reconcile Multiple sources of data and say okay, which which data source are we gonna hold as the source of truth? How do we validate it because you know? Regard taking a step outside of language technology like LLMs You have to do data validation regardless So hallucination is just a new kind of thing that you have to address So, hallucination is just a new kind of thing that you have to address. So, another way to think of that is, imagine that you've got various sources of information, you've got multiple internal sources of information, you might have vendors and APIs that you get information from. How do you cross-validate and how do you reconcile those differences? That's something that you can talk about. Like I said, reconciliation is a really big thing in your finance department, so if you've got any finance people, talk to them about how they reconcile different pieces of information and different sources, and you'll get a tremendous amount of insight about how, you know, so for instance, like error detection, cleansing, all that sort of stuff, all the transformations that it goes through, so on and so forth. Factual grounding. And so what factual grounding is, this is more from philosophy, but it's also super, super, super important with language technology, which is you just need to state what your factual grounding is. What is the bedrock set of facts, data, and assertions that you're operating from? So what data are you are using what empirical evidence? Where are your sources? Is it consistent that sort of thing? But really just like think about when you're building either chat bots or other language technology What is the factual grounding and you have to be explicit you have to give it the factual grounding? even if it's just a few like like sentence fragments where you say like X is true or assume Y is the case or giving it some context like this is a construction company. It's amazing how much just a few little keywords will, will shape and steer language models because if you tell it like, hey, we're a wall street firm, like that's two word or three words Wall Street firm versus like you know, you know military hardware, you know consultant those two like just those two things give it so much context and it's going to perform a lot better by grounding whatever it's doing in some of those facts. So that's what I mean by factual grounding. Just give it really objective empirical baseline. Like what is what is going on. Because remember, you as a person, you implicitly have all that factual grounding because you know your job, you see your physical surroundings. The language model exists in a tiny little bottle, bottled up brain out in the ether somewhere, so it has no context. Source of truth. So source of truth, this comes from, well I used it a lot in IT infrastructure because, so say for instance you've got different login databases, you've got different user roles, you've got authentication servers and that sort of stuff, so then you have to have a source of truth. Who is allowed to log into what? So this is like role-based access control. And so if you don't have a single source of truth, which you can end up... Story from the front. If you give developers the keys to the kingdom, you end up with no single source of truth because developers generally don't understand authentication schemes. And so you end up with local logins on every server or multiple key servers and that sort of thing. And that is bad because one, that is a security nightmare. Two, it is an access nightmare and so on and so forth. So this is why accessibility, audit trails, data integrity, that sort of stuff. So source of truth. For any given data ontology or type, you need to identify who is the key authority here. So say for instance you're getting stock market data. There's going to be certain APIs, like what is it, the EDI system? Where you can download all the financial filings from the SEC. That is a source of truth. That is what I mean by a source of truth. If you're trying to keep time, NIST is the source of truth for the current time. But why? Because they sync their clocks to all the nuclear clocks around the world. So by identifying sources of truth for each piece of information, you can establish layers of truthfulness and reliability and validity. And you can also establish some internal sources of truth. So say, for instance, you have like a master KB article or a set of documents that is well curated and you say, if there's ever any disagreement, default to this. It's like having a constitution, right? This is how America makes judicial decisions, is that the constitution is held up as the ultimate source of truth and then there's layers of truthiness below the US Constitution. Axiomatic principles. So axiomatic principles are the core assertions, the first principles or the fundamental assumptions that you're making when you're doing a particular business task or working with certain information. And so one thing that I recommend people doing is any assumptions that you're making, say them out loud. Tell the model that like, hey recommend people doing is any assumptions that you're making, say them out loud. Tell the model that like, hey, assume that X is true, or assume that this is the ethical framework that we're using when we're making this decision. Or, you know, one of the things that we're operating on is like this model of SEO. Because if you just say like, write an optimized web page, it'll do its best. But then if you say, write an SEO optimized web page it'll do its best, but then if you say write an SEO optimized web page according to this theory, right, by giving the model axiomatic principles you're going to get much better results that are adherent to specific paradigms, schools of thought, that sort of thing. And this applies to whatever business domain you're in, whether you're doing copywriting, whether you're doing hospitals, and also which country you're in. So different countries have different regulations, and so if you say, adhere to the cultural norms of Sweden, these are the cultural axiomatic beliefs that we're operating by when you interact with your users, or whatever. Okay, so next, data taxonomy. So taxonomy, the most familiar taxonomy that people are familiar with is the taxonomy of life, right? So you've got the five kingdoms of life and then you've got various file and order below that. And so what you can do is you can create data taxonomies that are very similar where you've got basically nested categories, where at the highest level of your AI infrastructure or data infrastructure, you've got like, is this a financial record? Is this an employee record or whatever? You can generally follow kind of the departments because each department can be considered a data domain or a domain of expertise. And then of course, each department may be further subdivided and this is not necessarily, I'm not saying like put it in a file system, this is really good for metadata. And if you have a standardized taxonomy that you can use across your entire organization, this is a non-trivial problem. But imagine how Linnaeus felt when he was trying to create a taxonomy for literally all life on earth. If you treat your business as data and you say, we're going to come up with a singular taxonomy for literally every piece of data in our company, that's going to really increase the searchability in the future, which is going to make it much more accessible to all of your AI technology. A classification system. So a classification system is very similar to a taxonomy. And so the two most familiar classification systems that you're going to be familiar with in terms of information are going to be the Dewey Decimal System, which is a way of just rapidly bucketing, hey, this piece of information, here's a number that just kind of gives it a rapid category. The other one that's a little bit more comprehensive is the Library of Congress, which is a more taxonomical system because it has some nested hierarchies. Now, the advantages here is that this allows you to address novel pieces of information. So whether you have a very rigid taxonomy, in which you're saying, hey, this is the structure in which we slot literally everything in our business, or you have a more general purpose classification system that says, hey, given the context of this piece of information, where it came from, what it's for, this is its classification. Again, you can use both of these in your metadata, which is going to add more layers of how do you use this. Data curation. So, one thing that a lot of people have asked me about is like version control. And so, having married a librarian and talking about like archival studies and reference librarianship and all that kind of fun stuff, I know and what you are probably discovering is that data curation is a non-trivial task. Data gets updated over time, it gets invalidated, it comes from different sources and so this is why I talk so much about librarianship is because you basically have to have your master collection. And you know, you might keep the older books or the older documents that are out of date, but then you need metadata to say, hey, this is out of date, this has expired. If you use ServiceNow, ServiceNow actually has settings where you can have KB articles automatically expire. It's one of the most annoying things for people who have like, no, this is a permanent KB article, and then it automatically archives it. But the idea is that data and information has an expiration date, or it might have an expiration date, and you need to be explicit about this. And so this is what I mean by data curation. And so by constantly updating your collection, updating the tags, updating the metadata, updating the expiration dates, these are all going to be clues that allow you to sift through and say, okay, well, if we have two otherwise identical articles, trust the more recent one. Or if we have two relatively identical articles, trust the one that came from the more trusted source of truth. ETL. ETL stands for extract, transform, and load. This is data warehousing where basically this is how you move data around the data warehouse, which is why I imagine this nice futuristic data warehouse with heavy equipment moving data around. ETL is an existing practice that your data people are going to be familiar with. Now, generative AI is just going to be a new tool for them to move data around their data warehouses. It's going to give them more options in terms of transformations of the data. It's going to give them more options in terms of validating the data, automating the data processing, and that sort of thing. So again, this is an established business practice that you can just research and say, oh, generative AI is just a new tool in this bucket and it's an existing discipline. And then finally, information foraging. So this one comes from Information Science. So information foraging, everyone, if you exist today, you know what information foraging is. You might not have the word for it. So information foraging is when you go out into an information environment looking for information and you're not exactly sure what you're looking for, but you have an information need and you're trying to solve that information need. And so then you go to your favorite hunting grounds, whether it's Google or YouTube or you've got a Discord or Slack channel that you go ask questions. And so then, information foraging is something that you're actually going to have to automate and enable your autonomous agents, your chatbots, and your other generative AI cognitive architectures to be able to engage in information foraging. Because they're going to have an information need in order to serve a user query or whatever. And so then it's like, okay, well, where do they go looking for that information? Is the information spoon-fed to them by automatic search queries? looking for that information. Is the information spoon-fed to them by automatic search queries? Does the agent have a model where it's able to say, hey I need this kind of information, where can I go find it? That sort of thing. Okay, so I just threw a whole lot of complex concepts at you. It's like drinking from the fire hose, you're probably going to need to watch this several times or go check out the slide deck and do a lot of googling. Now let's get to the practical implementation. Alright so the number one thing absolutely that I recommend to literally every customer is start with a data-centric model. So this is based on the von Neumann architecture of computing where computing happens in memory and then the memory is operated on by computation. But really the center of it is your data, it is your information. Treat all of your business processes and tasks as fundamentally as information problems. So basically you have information flowing into your organization or circulating around your organization and then flowing out of your organization. And that information can be any kind of information. It can be a bill that needs to be paid. It can be a customer query. It can be regulatory requirements. Literally everything you do is fundamentally an information problem, and there are information needs. And I apologize, I meant to add information needs as one of the concepts. So let me do that real quick. I've said information needs a few times. So information needs comes from the world of librarianship where any time a patron walks into a library, the reason that they walk into the library and go to the circulation desk is because they have an information need. Now that information need, talk to a librarian, they have the most hilarious stories. Those information needs could be anything from There's a snake in the lobby What do I do about it to there's a three-year-old throwing up in the kids section to I'm looking for a book on like You know penis enhancement or whatever librarians get the weirdest thing so they they Cut up a client or a customer or patron comes to you with an information need, and then there is a process to one, figure out what that information need truly is, and then serve that information need. So by treating literally everything that happens in your company as an information need, you're gonna really change your orientation to it, because then what is the outcome? Also the outcome, if you use the librarianship model, is very clear. The patron walks away with the piece of information that they need, the book that they need, or their problem is solved. That kind of thing. So that's number one of the data-centric model. Number two, information thy God. In the fiction space for us novel writers, we have this phrase that says, thy God the reader, which is basically, we might be writing for ourself, but it's ultimately the reader that's gonna decide what it is that we write and do and what succeeds. And in this case, information and data, that is your God. Because everything in your business is an information problem, information is the actual thing that you are serving in order to provide the goods and services that make your company viable. So goods and services are the output, that's the economic interface between your company and the world, but information is how you do that, and information is how you do that well. So another way to think about this is data is the new oil. So information thy God, data is the new oil. So information thy God, data is the new oil. By adopting a data-centric approach to literally every good service, process, protocol, task, you'll have a better understanding of how generative AI can intersect and augment your business. And then finally, this is just a really kind of boilerplate way to think about what generative AI can do. And these are the types of transformations what generative AI can do. These are the types of transformations that generative AI can do. There's three fundamental types. The way that you can categorize it is, what is the size of the input versus the size of the output? There's shrinking operations or shrinking transformations, which is summarization, extraction, and classification. You put in a big chunk of text, and you get out a small chunk of text. That is that. The second type is translation or other transformation, where the input size and the output size is roughly the same. In this case, this might be a format change. It might be changing to another language. For instance, you might translate from XML to JSON. That's a translation example. You might translate it from English to Japanese. That's a translation example. Another example for a shrinking thing is evaluation. I forgot to add that. A shrinking operation is I use this extensively in using Clawed and ChatGPT to provide feedback. Feedback and critique is another example of a shrinking transformation where it's like, assess the quality of this thing. Give me critique. And so the output is smaller than the input. And then finally, expanding. The input is smaller than the output. And so this is stuff like brainstorming, synthesizing, drafting, being creative, drafting prose, which Claude can do that sometimes, but I tell it not to because it's really hot on the biscuit to just draft whatever it wants, and it is not good often. But you can draft legal documentation. You can draft KB articles. So by understanding that you have these three fundamental types of data transformations that is available to you through Generative AI, then you can subcategorize, okay, what other operations do we have access to? Maybe I'll do a video on all the different kinds of operations, and I'll create my own Generative AI data transformation taxonomy. Okay, search strategies. So, there are four fundamental search strategies that are available to you today with generative AI. And so basically, as I mentioned just a minute ago, you have information needs as a person, as a business, your chatbots have information needs, your users have information needs, everyone has user information needs, and we talked about information foraging. So these are the actual strategies, the techniques that you can use to approach your information foraging problems. Now the first one obviously is vector search. You're probably watching this video because you realize that vector search is not cutting the mustard anymore. So there's a few primary things that people don't understand about vector search. Vector search is not like Google and it is not like SQL. Where vector search, people try and treat it like query document. So where you have like in SQL you might have a specific structured query like find everything that includes X, Y, and Z with A, B, and C criteria. For Google you're kind of matching keywords to a document. But really what vector search really shines for is clustering similar documents. And so what I mean by that is that, here's a perfect example. Documents with similar formats and similar contexts are going to be the best thing to kind of cluster and use. So imagine that you're a scientist and you're looking for every paper that is similar to a paper you're looking at. So for literature review, you say, hey, give me every paper like this one. So you feed the vector search an entire paper, you vectorize an entire paper, and then it's going to find everything that is semantically similar to that paper, and it's going to be perfect. So that is one of the primary things that vector primary things that people get wrong about vector search. Yes, there are vectors and embeddings that are made for query document matching, but those are not good. They might get good in the future, but from a mathematical perspective, that is not what vector searching is for. Vector searching is more for clustering similar things together. You might do the same thing for KB articles. So imagine that you have an internal KB system and you bring up a KB article and then at the end it's like, here's the five most similar KB articles. And so rather than clustering similar KBs or similar scientific papers or other documentation on keywords or other things, you can cluster them based on what's actually written on the page. This can also be useful for things like fictional documents. So some people keep piles and piles and piles of fictional documents together. And so then it's like, hey, I've got this character sheet and this chapter. Find all the other chapters like this other chapter, that sort of thing. Number two is knowledge graphs. So knowledge graphs are kind of a hybrid between relational databases and some of these squishier, more web-like things. If you're not familiar with knowledge graphs, probably the easiest way to think about a knowledge graph is think of a Wikipedia page where Wikipedia has references and cross links to other pages and each of those cross links has a semantic meaning. There's a reason that the Eiffel Tower page is linked to the Paris, France page. And so that is what I mean by knowledge graphs. So like a knowledge graph is just basically the web with a little bit more like, you know, whatever. Anyways, you can use language technology to create, traverse, and read knowledge graphs. I know that there's going to be some purists out there saying that that's not what it is at all, but from a functional standpoint, a knowledge graph is just a web of content. Number three is metadata filtering. Most vector search databases have the ability to filter based on metadata, and certainly relational databases do as well. And so this is why I talk so much about metadata and data curation, is because if you have vector search collections and you're surfacing things that are not necessarily relevant, it's because you're surfacing documents that are very similar to what your search query is, but they're not necessarily relevant because you don't have the correct ontologies or taxonomy or classification system where it's like, okay, do a search with this vector, but I only want this particular type of data, this particular category. And then finally, number four is indexes or a table of contents. So this is something that, as far as I know, I pioneered in some of my coding experiments. But basically you generate a table of contents or a menu that your language model can choose from and it says, oh, I need this KB article. And then it can request and fetch that specific KB article where And then it can request and fetch that specific KB article. Where basically you're kind of cutting out the middleman. Instead of having semantic search, you're saying, hey, read this document, read this menu, read this table of contents, tell me which information you need, I'll go get it, and then you can have like nested layers of tables of contents and whatever. This may or may not pan out as useful, but in the experiments that I've done with it, it's been extremely useful because then with the given context of whatever information problem your language model is facing, it will be able to say this is probably what I need access to. The next thing for practical implementation is a gated process. So there's many things that you can do in one step, And of course, if you ask the machine learning engineers and scientists, the AI is going to be able to do everything in one step one day. But from a business perspective, first just know. And even from a biological perspective, that's not how human brains work. We all have internal workflows and processes, even if you're not fully conscious of them. And so there's three primary steps that you can think of for addressing any information need. First is the information query. So in that example that I gave you for someone approaching the circulation desk at a library, there's what's called the reference interview, which librarians use to figure out what the patron needs. So like, what is your question? What is the context behind your question? What is the outcome you're looking for? Is it a valid request? Right, because if you walk up to the circulation desk and you say like, hey, like, you know, something's happening on the other side of the city, the librarian might be like, okay, that sounds important, but I can't help you. So number one is, the first gate is the information query. You judge the validity of it. Is it an appropriate question? Is it information that we can actually serve or not? Number two is distill, extract, and utilize. So this is, imagine when you go get a stack of books, you've talked to the librarian, you've got a legitimate information query, and then you go get a stack of books. So then what you do is you take a dozen books and you flip through them and you take notes, you copy the pages that you need, and you compile the most salient bits of information so that now you've consolidated the information that you need to actually solve your information problem. And then finally, format and deliver. Let's let's imagine that you went to the library to help you with filing building plans for a new house, right? So while you're at the library, you got all the code books, you got all the architectural diagrams, you got it all copied. Now what you do is you package it up and send it out to the architect or you send it out to the inspector or whatever. So that's what I mean by inspect, or sorry, the query, distill, extract, utilize, and then format and deliver. By using a gated process with, you know, checkpoints, decision points, workflows, but by treating them as fundamentally different phases and handoff processes, you're going to have a lot more better results with your automation. And then finally, assembly lines. Look at all of your business, whether it's internal or external, whether it's customer-facing or not. Everything that you do is work tasks and work products moving through an assembly line. Now, it's a digital assembly line. Sometimes it's a verbal assembly line, but if you look at your business as a collection of assembly lines, you're going to have a much better way of automating it. So, there's a few primary components of assembly lines. One is inputs. Where do work items come from? Where do the materials come from? Where does the information come from? Emails, calls, bills, API calls. Does it come from vendors? Does it come from users? Does it come from users? Does it come from internal stakeholders? There's always inputs to every assembly line. And again, like I said, there's going to be multiple assembly lines. Number two, there's stations. The whole point of an assembly line is that you quickly move work products or work items or materials from one station to the next. And deciding which station it goes to next is one part of the problem, but then also what information, tools, and transformations are done at that station. So for instance, in automobile assembly lines, the first part is you build the frame, then you start bolting on the motor and the electronics, and then you put in the wiring, and then finally you paint it. So you have the painting station, you have the welding station, you have the the engine station, that sort of thing. So think about the stations of your business. You know, when does a work product move from procurement to material handling? When does it move from finance to billing to wherever else it goes? Interfaces. So look at the interfaces. So an interface is a handoff point. This is when it changes from one person or one department to another. Is it coming from your vendor to your CFO? Is it going from your finance department to your IT department? That's what I mean by interfaces. And then finally, outputs. What is the final result of a given work product or process? Is it that a bill gets paid? Is it that a patient gets discharged from the hospital? Is it that material is delivered on site and then it's out of your hands? What are the input stations, interfaces, and outputs? Treat it all like information moving through a digital assembly line or a digital factory, and you will be able to start working towards those polymorphic applications that I talked about in a previous video. Alright, thanks for watching, I hope you got a lot out of this. Like I said, all the most important links are in the description.
