Well, then, confidentially, I am crazy, and I'll f***ing kill you. Well, it's been a wild and crazy month. Let's see what our interracial families have learned. I learned a lot from Sharron, and I learned a lot from little T-Martin. Quite frankly, I'll miss them both very much. And for the first time in my life, I tasted brown sugar. And not my oatmeal. Mm-mm-mm. Yeah, you know, on this show, you taught me that no matter where you come from, you know what I'm saying, or what color your skin is, we all pretty much do the same things in life. Raise our kids, make love from time to time, and wash. Speaking of which, I learned that white people don't use washcloths. Did you know that? I'm serious, they have one bar of soap in the house. Every time I use it, somebody else's pubic hair was in it. She's like, you use the cloth. Why you guys gotta put the raw bar soap in your butt and all this? Maybe I need to wash my face on my feet. Todd and Leonard are very different. Although Lynn is the love of my life. In a different world, I could see myself with Todd. Although the penis through the whole thing was kind of weird. And I am missing some of my draws. Oh. Oh, my gosh. Oh. Titty-wrizzle, too. Hello? Hello? -\u266a\u266a\u266a\u266a Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?
