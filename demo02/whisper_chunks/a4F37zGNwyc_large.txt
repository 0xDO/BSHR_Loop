{"text": " Welcome to my new series, Mythic Archetypes, Episode 1, Warrior, King, Magician, Lover. So a mythic archetype, this was initially introduced to us by Carl Gustav Jung, C.G. Jung, or to pronounce it more accurately, Jung, but to us American Anglophiles, Jung is easier to say. A mythic archetype is a universal symbol. The idea is that these symbols appear throughout the entire world and throughout all of history. Now, one thing to keep in mind though is that due to local variances, symbols often present just a little bit differently. Jung's theory of collective unconsciousness though was a very compelling idea that has since been kind of debunked or devalued, but we will talk a little bit more about my personal theories as to how this works in just a moment. The idea though is that something about human nature keeps coming back to these mythic symbols. Aspect of these that are basically timeless implies that it is something very deep in our psyche, perhaps even predating humanity as I'll talk about later in the video. Now as I just mentioned, there is often a lot of cultural variance between mythic archetypes. So for instance, in the Japanese tradition, the Bushido or the Samurai is one expression of a warrior archetype, but then of course in the West we have, you know, the knight in shining armor. Now while there are many similarities between both of these archetypes both wear armor both use swords Both have strict codes of honor and conduct Some of the underpinning ideas behind what makes a samurai good versus what makes a knight good Can be very different uh in many cases both samurai and Knights, uh swear fealty to some kind of liege lord. Not always, but the Bushido mentality is very different from that of a knight's mentality. Now, in both cases, though, when the archetypes go wrong, knights and samurai often behave badly in similar ways, such as becoming brutal and oppressive, which is one of the downsides of the warrior archetype. Another example of cultural variance is the dragon. So in the West, the dragon often represents the dark side of humanity. This is why you see in stories, the dragon hoards gold and abducts women and kills children and cattle. And so the idea there is that the dragon represents kind of the The dark side of our psyche and kind of our worst instincts Whereas in China in particular the dragon actually represents the highest form of deity in heaven And so in that case, it's entirely possible that the word dragon is just an anglophile it's entirely possible that the word dragon is just an Anglophile Kind of transplant that we put on China that is not necessarily like it's the same word But it's not necessarily the way that you would accurately represent it Because of the local cultural variances though mythic archetypes often express Very differently at least on the surface, but once you understand that there are underlying similarities, that is when you understand that cultural archetypes are somewhat universal. Again, there is local variance. So the point of today's video is to introduce the four primary Jungian masculine archetypes, the warrior, the king, the magician, and the lover. So this set of archetypes is, first and foremost, I think you need to understand that it is an oversimplification, but while they are oversimplified, these archetypes are universal in that they appear in every culture across all of humanity and across all of human history. The warrior represents the courage, the discipline, and skill. This is about attack or making change in the world. It's about mission, and it's also about protecting and boundaries. The king represents the highest amount of order and authority and leadership that men can possess or pursue. It's about status, but it's also about having good judgment and earning a place as a steward of their tribe. The magician represents secret knowledge. So basically, whether you're a medicine man or a lawyer or a scientist or an engineer or a shaman The magician represents those who possess secret in a secret energy or secret knowledge and then finally the lover is the zest for life the passion the romance the sensory and the pleasure aspect of masculine energy now of masculine energy. Now, before we go any further, I do need to say that there are literally an infinite number of potential archetypes out there, whether they are cultural figures like the Buddha or the Baba Yaga, whether they're religious figures like Jesus or whoever else. The reason that, and we'll go into a little bit more depth as to why I personally believe there's an infinite number of potential archetypes in just a moment from a neuroscience and evolutionary perspective, but we also see recurring themes in the archetypal world such as the hero, the mother, or the father, or the trickster. These archetypes appear in myths all over the entire world as well and so basically any particular pattern Whether it's a personification or an allegory or a character could become an archetype But one thing that has to happen is in order for an archetype to exist. It has to be shared via Usually religion stories or other common experiences. But the point here is that there is an infinite number of possible archetypes out there. However, we do seem to evolve or certain types of archetypes seem to emerge very reliably from one culture to the next. The one other aspect that you need to be aware of in terms of the cultural context today is depth psychology. So when we talk about Freud and Jung, we're talking about depth psychology, which went out of favor around the middle of the century in favor of behaviorism. And there's lots and lots of material about behaviorism and its limitations today, so we don't necessarily need to rehash that. But it is important context to understand that basically in an attempt to make psychology more scientific, quote-unquote, they said, well, we can't observe what's going on in someone's brain, and there's plenty of evidence that people are even not fully conscious of what's going on in their brain. So let's figure, let's instead watch what people do. Let's measure their behavior and we'll just sort of assume that someone's behavior is an accurate representation of what's going on in their brain. Obviously there are some profound flaws with this, which is why behaviorism is currently under siege and is being put in its place, let's say. The real approach to psychology is an intersectional approach where you take behaviorism, you take psychology, you take neuroscience, you take history and anthropology and mythology, all of that, everything that humans do is predicated on the human brain. And so literally anything that you study that has to do with humans is also by extension a study of the human brain. There's another component of this which is decolonization So decolonization is the recognition that for most of most of Western history white men like myself have been the ones that have dominated the academics and the sciences and the Recognition that that a very narrow cultural view has been part of the conversation is narrow cultural view has been part of the conversation is what is the goal of decolonization and to say hey let's take multiple perspectives and then of course pop pop culture has also had a profound influence on the resurrection of depth psychology basically Jung is having a moment right now okay so we've talked around archetypes and some of the historical context, but what is an archetype? When I say a mythic archetype, what do I mean? So first, when I say mythic archetype, these are some of the things that I think about and these are some of the things that I have come to believe in terms of what a mythic archetype actually is. First and foremost, a mythic archetype is an unconscious distillation. So basically part of how our brains work is that over time we create distilled and abstracted representations of the things that we see and do and experience. And we do this for all things, not just personification such as, you know, the mother or father archetype. We do this for things like cars. It's how you're able to drive one car, and then once you have enough experience driving cars, you can jump into pretty much any car, because your brain has created abstract enough representations of how to drive that you can basically transfer that skill from one thing to another. This is how we generalize principles. Another aspect of this is it actually kind of makes sense from a neuroscience perspective in order to create these abstract representations. So for instance, being able to recognize similarities and patterns, basically archetypes, mythic archetypes, the simplest way that you could think of it, it is pattern recognition. You recognize patterns in life, in people that you meet, and in characters and stories that we tell each other. From philosophy there is a concept called reification. So reification, the Latin root word, is literally just like basically you could translate it as to thingify something or to make something into a thing. So when you reify something, you put a name to it and you create it as a thing that exists in your mind. So by labeling it, by creating it, it becomes a mental object that you can interact with and develop and refine over time. I already mentioned transdisciplinary discussion, but basically it bears repeating that the concept and discussion of archetypes spans many many disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, anthropology, history, religion, and pretty much all humanities including literature. By recognizing that mythic archetypes are everywhere and any time that you talk about the human condition you are talking about the way that the human brain works and anytime that you talk about the human condition, you are talking about the way that the human brain works, and archetypes can apply to that. And then, as was already mentioned, archetypes are often universal models. Now, again, you have to keep in mind that different cultures have different views, and so while something is potentially a universal model, that doesn't necessarily mean that it exists in all minds equally at all times as is sometimes implied by the Jungian concept of collective unconsciousness. In fact, the idea of collective unconsciousness is that collective unconsciousness does have boundaries and it is defined by epistemic tribes, in other words, groups of people that have similar cultural experiences emotional experiences Language shared stories and that sort of thing Now because though we're all humans and we'll talk about this in a minute, but because we're all humans and we have similar Neurological hardware and similar instincts we kind of converge on similar archetypes over time So one bit of evidence that I pay attention to is dreams. So dreams are highly varied culturally in terms of how we think about them. For instance, many cultures either place no value or are actually suspicious of dreams. So in some cultures basically talking about dreams is considered witchcraft or something else that is that is taboo but in some cultures dreams are considered very very important and portentous and so what we see is that but depending on what your culture's disposition is towards dreams this will have actually a pretty profound impact on your memory and perception of your own dreams so for instance cultures that are hostile to dreams, people will report not remembering them or even straight out saying they don't have dreams. On the other hand, cultures that place a high value on dreams, people remember their dreams more, the dreams are more vivid, and they feel connected and comfortable with those dreams. So the fact that your culture can influence your dreams, and also that there's other things that can influence your dreams. So for instance, people that engage in Jungian psychoanalysis or transpersonal psychology, they often report that their dreams become more vivid and more meaningful and that they remember them more. Simple practices such as dream journaling also makes your dreams more vivid and more memorable. So this implies that there's a two-way relationship between the conscious experience and decisions that you make and the unconscious mind. And this is one of the most important things that underpins Jungian theory about collective unconsciousness. If there is in fact a two-way relationship between your conscious experience and the symbols and models that your unconscious mind develops as evidenced by the by our relationship with dreams that does provide some evidence that there could be a quote-unquote collective unconsciousness that has developed over time. Another piece of evidence that I pay attention to is psychedelic experiences. So I've read several books and of course there's many subreddits from people all over the world talking about their psychedelic experiences and there are very common experiences and themes to psychedelic experiences whether it's purely synthetic such as DMT I read DMT but the spirit molecule there's also shamanic traditions all over the world usually having to do with naturally occurring mushrooms or other substances like ayahuasca, which is brewed from several different ingredients. But then there's also other practices, whether it is ritualistic practices or religious practices that can induce psychedelic experiences as well. And there's a few common tropes across all of these. So one is the insectoid beings that are often reported in many psychedelic experiences. There's also frequently angelic, demonic, or ethereal beings. And of course whatever language someone has and whatever cultural baggage they bring into their experience, they'll usually use their local terminology. But like, not everyone is from a Judeo-Christian background, so they might not use the word angelic or demonic, but they will describe things that could be seen as angelic, demonic, or ethereal. Another common thing, theme in many psychedelic experiences is the experience of some kind of maternal or paternal energy. So basically some people might might feel like there is some kind of masculine protective force during their experience or a maternal or feminine nurturing energy. This varies from person to person, it varies from culture to culture, it also seems to depend on the substance that someone uses to have that experience. In many cases, the experiences are terrifying or very challenging. And so because of this, many people will interpret what they're experiencing through their particular cultural lens. They might say that they experienced God or Jesus or Satan. If they are People from Eastern traditions, they'll use entirely different sets of words a different lexicon to describe it But when you examine it, there are some very powerful common themes behind all psychedelic experiences And again, this implies that there is something common happening in all human brains. Now, I'm not saying that there's magical is that there is something common happening in all human brains. Now, I'm not saying that there's magical, you know, unconscious, you know, sixth sense telepathy happening between all human brains. But what I'm saying is that because of similar experiences and common experiences and the fact that we're all the same species, we converge on similar experiences in dreams and psychedelics. So from an evolutionary perspective, these archetypes actually make a lot of sense to me. So for instance, every culture has some expression of a king archetype, whether it is clan chiefs or presidents or generals, pretty much any culture has some expression of, you know, of patriarchal leadership. And this is, again, universal. Even in some societies where there are matriarchs, they still take on this archetypal role of leader and head judge or decider for the clan. We even see this in non-human animals. So, for instance, orcas. They are matriarchal, but the the the matriarch of an orca pod is the de facto leader. The second one is the lover archetype. And so the lover archetype is, for men, is the pursuit of pleasure and joy and self-indulgence. And these are required in order to procreate because a man who does not have the lover Archetype the lover energy is not going to reproduce. They're not going to be interested in women. They're not going to be interested in sex They're not going to be interested in fun. They're going to be relatively bland and so just from an evolutionary perspective it makes sense for people to have some hedonic energy and indulge in things just because they feel good. And of course, biology shapes what feels good because over time we are selected for people that indulge in things that tend to result in the perpetuation of the species. Likewise, the warrior archetype is seen across all of humanity and many animals. Basically, it's a dog-eat-dog world out there and because of the competitive environment that we find ourselves in, every animal, particularly men, need to have some kind of warrior energy in order to kill or be killed or eat or be eaten. The clan that is unable or unwilling to fight for its place is going to go extinct. And then finally the magician archetype is this one is more unique to humans because we are so incredibly curious. The value and desire for hidden knowledge is our superpower as a species. We are the most curious species by a mile and so how do you represent that as an archetype? You represent that as we elevate people who find and possess secret knowledge. Why? Because the acquisition and pursuit of secret knowledge is a superpower for the human species. Now one thing that I've alluded to is while I don't, I'm not saying that any of this is magical. I'm not saying that there's some mystical substrate that we're all communicating in some dream world. It's possible, but I don't see any evidence for it, and we don't need that magical explanation. But instead, if we look at archetypes similar to language, it's entirely possible that we have an instinct to develop archetypes in the same way that we have an instinct to develop language. So if same way that we have an instinct to develop language. So if you read the book, The Language Instinct by Steven Pinker, he talks about how there is ample evidence that we develop and acquire language purely by instinct. Basically, you don't need to be actively taught language, you just need to be passively exposed to language as an infant, as a toddler, and you will acquire language. Likewise, I think that there is plenty of evidence to show that we have an archetypal instinct or an inborn genetic evolved instinct to acquire mental archetypes. And it serves a lot of purposes from our place in society and to create complex social networks. OK, so let's get into the specific archetypes. First up is the king archetype. The king archetype obviously represents leadership. The king is the chief of the clan who makes decisions and says, this is the way things are. They are also the one who is most responsible for the preservation of the tribe. And again, while I mentioned that not all human societies are patriarchal, even matriarchal societies they have the same role. If you have a queen, if you have a woman who is in control, they still serve the same role. And in this case, you know, they might be charged with being the ultimate arbiter of justice. They might be charged with leading the military or making diplomatic decisions. In smaller cases, you might have the patriarch of a family or a small clan. So for instance, in American football, you have the quarterback who is sort of the king on the field. You might say that the coach is the king of the team because the coach is the one who ultimately decides how they're going to do everything. Anyways, point being is that we see this archetype emerging in all aspects of life. Kings often have moral authority. And so what I mean by moral authority is that they are the ones who issue that judgment about wisdom and fairness. Now in Western culture, in most cultures today, honestly, we have systematized this where we delegate to judges and magistrates in order to make some of these decisions. But this is basically a delegation of the role of king, which is why justices are often appointed by presidents and monarchs, because it's basically the authority of the judge is an extension of the authority of the king or whoever the leader is. Kings also consecrate ceremonies. So as the highest authority, basically the party gets started when they say it does. We see this over and over again in tribal societies where the chief is the one who presides over it. And in fact, that's why we chose the name president in America as the highest leader is the president is the one who presides over all else in the nation. And then as I already mentioned, they provide judgment. Another aspect of this, the reason why many men are either obsessed with or at least fascinated by King archetypes is because it also represents a desire for status. All humans have an intrinsic desire for increasing their social status, but men in particular, your social status is directly tied to a lot of things such as the quality of food that you get, the quality of attention that you get, and also the quality and reproductive opportunities that you get. So we have a biological evolved need for status and the king represents the apogee of achieving high status. The warrior archetype as I already mentioned is about the ability to use aggressive energy. So whether that means you need to use aggression to protect your clan or yourself or whether you need to use that aggressive energy to secure resources for the people that you care about, this is basically seen throughout many many animals in the world where you will fight to either survive, you will preserve yourself, or you will kill to eat. And so this is about having a mission to go out into the world and having energy to make change or to protect people. The warrior energy is often characterized as being selfless, where you are willing to sacrifice yourself for the greater good This is something that you see Especially in Bushido for the samurai you see this in in the example of the US Marine Corps Where it is very systematically ingrained into soldiers that like you are there for a purpose And if you're ordered to go and put yourself in Danger you might die and that is part of what you're signing up for and there is often a lot of honor associated with with fighting and dying so for instance Vikings they go to Valhalla if they die in Service of combat if they die on the battlefield they automatically go to Valhalla. So that is part of how they basically codify this underpinning mythic archetype, whereas it is one of the highest honors as a warrior to die in service to your people. And in some cases, this is codified to the extent that they actually have a death cult where the goal is to die in combat, which, you know, may or may not be healthy, but that is something that exists in many cultures. And this is what I mean by this warrior archetype is often cultivated in many nations today, and of course in many cultures throughout history. The lover archetype is fundamentally about hedonistic energy or hedonic energy. The idea is that we have, you know, from a medical standpoint, we have biochemical rewards. You eat good food, you get a dopamine rush. You have sex with an attractive woman, you have a dopamine rush and oxytocin and endorphins and all that good stuff. Basically, this is one way to look at it is the lover archetype is one's willing and ability to engage in the pleasures of life. But then again, when you look at it from an evolutionary perspective, why do we have those biochemical rewards in the first place? As one TED talk famously said, sex is for making babies, but that's not why we do it. We do sex because it feels good. Our body tricks us into doing things that tend to promote the species such as we pursue good food and we pursue pleasurable experiences. Why? Because those tend to create more coherent societies. They also tend to result in babies in the long run. And so this is from a male perspective. the lover archetype is basically saying, okay, this is about me experience what feels good to me, what is the most pleasure that I can get out of life, because just by following that archetypal energy, you will eventually be, you know, the life of the party and you'll get more attractive lovers and you'll have more reproductive opportunities and that sort of thing. But this can be codified or personified as the lover archetype. And then finally, the magician archetype. So the magician archetype, as I mentioned, is the keeper of secret knowledge. From a human perspective, we are deeply curious. We are systematic thinkers who are constantly trying to unpack and understand the world around us. In ancient times, this would have been the shamans and the medicine men and the wise people of the tribe, sometimes medicine women as the witches go. So again, I don't really differentiate between masculine and feminine in many cases, but this is where Jung started, where everything was masculine archetypes. You know, take it with a grain of salt. Anyways, point being is that there is always a tremendous value in having secret knowledge, whether that is a specific profession such as medicine or law or science or engineering or technology, or it is something something secret about humanity. So shamans are also the ones who conduct ceremonies for people. So these are people that are good speakers, they're the master of ceremony and that sort of thing. Now obviously, as I mentioned, the king archetype is often the master of ceremony. They're the ones that consecrate the ceremony, but often they will give their power to the shaman and the shaman will have their role in a ceremony in order to bring the energy to where it needs to be. But basically the magician is the personification of human curiosity. It is the rigorous pursuit of knowledge and understanding, particularly valuable is secret knowledge. It is about exploration and discovery and the fact that our sense of curiosity is so powerful that it is actually a biologically ingrained compulsion. Okay, so as we wind down the video I want to hit on two fictional examples of these paragons of masculinity. Now first and foremost is Aragorn. So Aragorn is, you know, the return of the king from Lord of the Rings. Obviously he is by name a king and so you look at everything that Aragorn is, you know, the return of the king from Lord of the Rings. Obviously, he is by name a king, and so you look at everything that Aragorn does, he protects people first and foremost, but also at the very end when he presides over a ceremony at Minas Tirith, that is an example of the president role of the king, the one who presides over the celebrations and the mornings and everything else. Aragorn, before he becomes king, he is a competent warrior. So if you watch, if you re-watch the two towers, you'll see during the battle of Helm's Deep, Aragorn and Gimli are like the best warriors on the battlefield, and so they almost single-handedly save the day until Gandalf shows up with with some friends. But the idea is that Aragorn has the willingness and ability to sacrifice himself for the protection of the people that he cares about and that is the quintessence of the warrior energy. Next up is the lover. So Aragorn is constantly thinking about this elven beauty, one of the most beautiful women in the land, and this represents the libido, the fact that he wants something in his life, specifically a fertile woman. Granted, she's much older than him, but in this world, she's still young and fertile. And so basically what he has to do is step up into his role as warrior and king in order to be worthy of that woman, in order to give himself permission to indulge in that level of pleasure. Now obviously this is very objectifying and that's not exactly what I mean, but when you look at it from an egocentric perspective, Aragorn wants the pretty woman because she's a pretty woman and because she's high value and high status. And then finally the magician. You see this less on the screen in the movies, but Aragorn is also extremely well read. You see this when you first meet him or first see him again in Rivendell where he's reading a book. He is, I think, one of the only people that you see reading a book on screen other than Gandalf. And so you see that you see this more in the books where Aragorn is incredibly intelligent. He's very well read, he's read all the histories, he's read all the deep lore, he knows elven medicines and all of that other fun stuff, and this is again evidence that he possesses secret knowledge. He doesn't have as much secret knowledge as Gandalf because he's not a wizard, but the idea is that Aragorn embodies all four of these masculine archetypes in spades. And finally, Tony Stark, a flawed paragon. So, Tony Stark, the reason that Tony Stark resonates with people, the reason that he became such a powerful symbol for the MCU, and the reason that the MCU is not the same without Robert Downey Jr., is because Tony Stark represents basically a more kind of realistic flawed paragon. At the beginning of Tony Stark's journey, he is a lover and magician. We see him chasing pretty women, and he's the genius billionaire playboy philanthropist, right? He's got a lot of money because he's super smart, and he uses that status to chase women and pleasurable experiences. However, you might say that this is an over-exaggerated hedonistic lifestyle. This is an unhealthy lover energy where he has doubled down on pleasure rather than other aspects such as mission and responsibility. So over time, we see Tony Stark develop as a warrior. Once he builds the Iron Man suit he starts to physically embody the warrior energy and so then part of being a warrior is that he has a new mission. His mission is world peace and the protection of humanity. And then finally at the end of his character arc he steps into the role of King where he personally takes responsibility for the protection of not just humanity, but the entire universe, and is willing to sacrifice himself in order to defeat Thanos. And so in that respect, Tony Stark, at least in the MCU, has over time, as a very flawed person has finally embodied every aspect of the four masculine archetypes. So thanks for watching. I hope you got a lot out of this.
