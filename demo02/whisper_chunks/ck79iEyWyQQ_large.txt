{"text": " So this is part two of a three part series where we will build a website with AI assistance. So I highly recommend you go back and watch part one if you haven't already. Anyway, let's get started with part two. So if you didn't watch the last episode, we ended with picking our domain and our host. So in this episode, we're gonna start with content creation with GPT-3 and we're gonna use David Shapiro's script that he wrote that is open source that creates blog posts or articles. It's really good and you should, if you're into GPT-3 and large language models, you should really go check out his YouTube channel and his GitHub if you want this script. So I'm gonna leave that in the description below. It's highly recommended. And we're gonna prep the content we create. We're gonna do some image creation with Mid Journey, assembly fusion from the prompts we created last episode. Set up the website. That's probably going to go quite fast. And we're going to deploy some content with our four topics. So let's just get going. So here we are in David Shapiro's script. I'm not going to go through how the script works now. I'm just going to leave his video in the description so you can go watch how the scripts work there. But basically everything is almost written. You just need to fill in what you want to write about. So I have created our first prompt and that is I want to write a blog post about AGI. I like to know what artificial general Intelligence is, its history and if it will be a reality. So this is gonna go and create a bunch of outlines and just loop through them and create better and better outlines until finally it writes. The length is not determined, we just have to see in the end, but it's going to be quite a good chunk of a blog post. So I think we just head over to the terminal and run the script. Okay. So we can watch how this boots up now and then I'm probably just gonna speed this up because it takes a bit of time. You can see here it writes the first outlines. What is AGI, the history. Here it goes again and runs an improved description for outlines. Here it comes up with 10 different things to write about. What is the risk of AGI? How can we prepare ethical implications? The future of AGI? Is AGI a reality? So here we can see the script starts to write for GPT-3 starts to write. So I'm just gonna let this run now and then we come back and see the final result. Okay so that was the script done. I think it took about I would say three four minutes. So we can see we have a big chunk of text here that is all about AGI. You can see we have how close are we to recreating, we have a list here, the potential application of AGI, automated vehicles, cyber security, speech recognition, robotics. But of course these are not with headlines. So what I'm going to do now is prep this text for deployment. Not now, but I'm going to have to do that before we can deploy it. But now I'm going to run the script with our three other topics. The script has now written content for all of our topics. You can see here we have machine learning, we have NLP, we have AGI, and we have deep learning. So the next thing I'm going to do now is prep the content so we get some headlines and it's ready to be deployed into our website. So I did some quick cleanup from the content we have created. So now I have four posts ready to deploy. We got the AGI and I just added a few of these headlines. We got three H2 headlines, the history, we got the future of AGI. We got some machine learning, deep learning, what is deep learning, the history, applications. Same with NLP. So I think these are quite okay content. Of course, it's not perfect, but it's quite good. And I read through it and it seemed pretty accurate. That's one thing you got to be careful with using AI. You got to double check and rewrite it. If something doesn't sound quite right, it's probably wrong. So yeah, that is four pieces of content ready to publish. So of course we need some images for our website. So what I'm going gonna do now is just run the prompts we created with GPT-3. I'm gonna just cycle through all of them and see which one which comes out the best. So let me just do a couple here now. So I'm gonna create a whole bunch of images now and then we are to pick out the ones we like the most for our four webpages. Okay so we have some result back for our images. Let's just have a look here. I think they look quite good. There are a few different ones here. This, I think this was augmented reality. That's quite cool. We got some AGI here. This was 3D printing, sounds strange. But we got some good pictures here we can use, so I'm pretty happy with this now. Okay so now we have our content, we have our images for the website. Now it's just to set it up. My plan is to do this in fast forward. Of course you can slow it down and watch the steps but I'm not gonna be explaining each detail so I'm gonna leave a link in the description with a tutorial to each step. So yeah, website setup. Okay, so that was the website is now up and running. So now we got to start adding some content. So I thought I'd just walk you through adding just the first post, then I'm just gonna do the rest after. So you just go to post, add new, and since we already have our structure here, I can just start copying the title. Paste it in here. Since we have the whole article here i can just copy this from docs should be really easy paste it and that should be about it uh okay of course you gotta do the paragraphs so they are easy to read right don't make them too long here i think this is okay maybe this long here. I think this is okay, maybe this could use like a... because no one likes really like a really big chunk of text. So I think this looks good. This maybe we can do 20, a bit big. This. Let's check it on mobile. this. Check it on mobile. You gotta add pictures and stuff later so, but for now I think this looks okay. Some other things you want to check is your categories. So here we're gonna go AGI. Our URL slug is gonna be artificial general intelligence like this. Save draft. Then add thing. We could just set an image for now. Let's do this. Picture of Asia. Alt text. Save. Preview. Okay. Looks good. Publish. So that should be our first article ready to go. Let's do a quick look at the site now. See if our post showed up here. Yeah. Popular post. Artificial General Intelligence. Okay, so that should be all the posts uploaded. It took me about five minutes. So if we update now, we should see all the posts go up. Yeah, four posts ready to go here. And these are all linked to our menu. So if you go deep learning, machine learning, NLP, AGI, home. Now we have a very nice space to just keep on building our website. So, happy with this so far. So that was part two done. So check out part three here, where we will do some final touches like homepage design, image integration, GPT-3 marketing tips, and finally the web page launch. So I hope I see you over there. generation, GPT-3 marketing tips and finally the web page launch. So I hope I see you over there.", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 6.24], "text": " So this is part two of a three part series where we will build a website with AI assistance."}, {"timestamp": [6.24, 12.88], "text": " So I highly recommend you go back and watch part one if you haven't already.
