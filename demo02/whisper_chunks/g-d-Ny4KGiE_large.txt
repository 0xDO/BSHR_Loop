{"text": " Morning everybody, David Shapiro here with a video. By popular demand, I am returning to my systems thinking series. Today's episode is episode four, which is distillation. Before we get into the show, I just wanted to do a quick plug for my Patreon. Patreon.com slash Dave Schapp. All tiers get you access to the private Discord, where we talk about AI, being neuro-spicy, philosophy, future of humanity, all kinds of fun stuff. The higher tiers also get you one on one access, whether through discord chats or consultations. One thing is that all of my content is ad free and open source, which is basically, that's my mission in life, which is to help steer humanity towards utopia. And I'm doing my part by producing as much valuable content as I can and putting it out into the world. And the exchange is that I get supported by the public, which I am supporting. So incentivize the behavior you wanna see, support me on Patreon, and with that, let's get back to the show. Okay, so what is distillation? When I say distillation in the context of systems thinking, it is the process of isolating the most fundamental or essential elements and features of a concept, idea, or system. So key thing is isolation. Simplification, it is also about simplifying complex ideas into more understandable and manageable forms, often by removing the extraneous or superfluous Aspects of it a lot of a lot of communication is just noise and then finally it's about presentation It is to get it down into something that is pretty elegantly simple it needs to be pure and Concentrated and optimized for communication. And so we'll unpack all of this as we go through the rest of the video. Now, so I will say the term elegant simplicity a few times, and the reason is because this is what you're aiming for. The end result of distillation is understanding and expressions of concepts that are elegantly simple. So for instance, E equals mc squared. This is an elegantly simple expression of an incredibly complex set of ideas. It often takes many years of work, lots of dead ends, lots of frustration, you have to look at something from many different angles, lots of sleepless nights, and sometimes very intense arguments. If you're a physicist, apparently physicists are pretty hardcore. Some of the physicists that I know literally get into fistfights over some concepts. Anyways, the end result that is elegantly simple tends to be very robust. And so, on top of the E equals MC squared example, another example is I was recently thinking about human evolution and society and that sort of things. And I asked myself the question, why do prisons exist? And so because of all the characteristics of what I'll talk about in just a moment, the end result that I came up with was that prisons are a systematic expression of the human instinct to banish or punish people who transgress upon the tribe. That is why prisons exist. That is an elegantly simple explanation and definition of prisons. It encapsulates sociology, history, evolution, philosophy. There's so much that went into this definition, and it is a very highly distilled and elegantly simple explanation of why prisons exist. And then another example is my personal mission, which took about four years to clarify, is steer humanity towards utopia. So by iteratively defining and refining and distilling what my mission was, I was able to get it down to four words. And those four words, there is not a single word lost. There is nothing superfluous in this description. It is an unassailable kernel of who I am. Okay, so now that you have a little bit of background about what distillation is and what it looks like, let's talk about how we get there. So the number one thing, the first thing, is transdisciplinarity. So being transdisciplinary used to be called being a polymath. So the university system was the idea of you become a universal man, which means that you know all things that are knowable. That is of course no longer possible because there's more information out there than anyone could possibly learn in a lifetime. Now, that being said, you can be transdisciplinary. And so how do you do this? One, through cross-pollination. You develop expertise in multiple disciplines, but also you don't just keep them in isolation. So this is one thing that really confuses me is a lot of people will say like, let's talk about philosophy or let's talk about science or let's talk about finance and most people seem to keep these things separate in their minds. And I don't understand how or why they do that. For me, it's partly instinctive, but it's also something that I've deliberately practiced, which is like, hey, what is what does quantum physics have to do with, you know, the economy or like, you know, what are what are these different disciplines have in common and what what can you generalize and hold in common between them. And so that cross-pollination is very important to distillation. Holistic complexity. So basically you take all these different disciplines and you synthesize new knowledge and new frameworks in order to address complex problems. And then this even furthermore is recombining disciplines. So basically if something is transdisciplinary, it is a new discipline that has been synthesized from multiple disciplines so you merge and synthesize something entirely new, an entirely new framework, an entirely new discipline based on the problems that you're solving and so in this case it's like okay well what are all the disciplines that are relevant to a given problem let me learn all about them and then merge them and synthesize them into a new discipline that is bespoke for this problem. Let me learn all of about them and then merge them and synthesize them into a new discipline that is bespoke for this problem. And then the final aspect, which I probably should have put this first actually is systematic curiosity. Deliberately explore your world and fill in the blanks. These are the raw ingredients that will go into the process of distillation. If you don't have a transdisciplinary approach or a rigorously systematically curious approach to the world, you're not gonna be able to distill anything because you don't have the raw ingredients to distill. The second part of distillation is mental scaffolding. So you will have to build mental scaffolding and depending on where you're at in life, you might still be building just from the ground up. So this is one of the purposes of school, of the reason that general education, whether it's K through 12 primary education or even secondary education that has requirements so that you're well-rounded. This is what we mean by well-rounded is that you've been exposed to enough different topics and different kinds of problems that you have a more comprehensive mental scaffolding of one how your own brain works to how the entire world works. So this is one of the key differentiating factors between many people who are uneducated versus educated is that they have a larger more robust and complete mental scaffolding of the world. Now, that being said, I have exactly five weeks of college in my life. I'm an autodidact, and so I deliberately built my own mental scaffolding rather than being spoon-fed by an institution. Now, okay, so what goes into a mental scaffolding? These are the cognitive frameworks that allow you to understand the world and solve problems. The larger and more complete your scaffolding is, the more holistic it is, the better understanding you have of the whole world. Also, by having a more complete mental scaffolding, you are able to better impute what you don't know. If there's a gap in your scaffolding, you can say, okay, well, there's a hole here, so there's this whole big thing that I don't know what I know. I know that I don't know this topic, that kind of thing. Having a good, robust mental scaffolding also helps you maintain systems perspective in the entire thing, because whether you're working on different ontological layers, you say, okay, is this a first principle or is this just a high-level concept, for instance? So you can kind of mentally keep track of where on the knowledge hierarchy you are, and then, so that's like the depth, right? And then there's also breadth. You know what your mental scaffolding covers in terms of topics, and you know what it doesn't cover. And so by reflecting on what you know and what you don't know, you're able to then infer and impute what you don't know and also to what depth. So breadth and depth, I probably should have added that to the mental scaffolding thing. But this is the process of distillation. I had not fully distilled this slide, but by teaching it to you, I surfaced another insight, which is mental scaffolding. You measure your mental scaffolding through breadth and depth. Okay, so ultimately you should have a mental scaffolding for all of your knowledge. And what I do is I consider the entire universe. All information is within a single domain and I can I can already hear my physicist friends out there saying, okay, but we literally don't know how to correlate quantum physics with classical physics. So even though, yes, they are in the same information domain, we don't even have the scientific scaffolding to fully connect the two. Yes, but by keeping in mind that the universe exists as a single information domain, you know that you're building one universal scaffold over the course of your lifetime. Iterative Refinement This is the essence of boiling it down. This is an ongoing process of improving and evolving your scaffolding frameworks and mental models. The goal here is to increase the accuracy, coherence, and utility of all the cognitive tools in your mental toolbox over time by synthesizing information from multiple disciplines. And one of the primary signals that you pay attention to is reducing cognitive dissonance, errors, and gaps. This is a repetitious cycle. It's a cyclical approach where you don't necessarily sit there and do it for like nine months and then you're done forever. You come back to iterative refinement, you know, every now and then over the course of your entire life. Basically what you're looking for is you're trying to optimize your mental models, one, to make them more accurate and useful, but also efficient and easier to use. The best mental models, one, to make them more accurate and useful, but also efficient and easier to use. The best mental models tend to be ones that generalize very broadly and have high accuracy and high utility, and this means extracting the key insights in order to make the most use of it. So, for instance, that definition that I have of prisons is a really useful definition because that helps you interpret everything about the prison system, why it exists, what its flaws are and and that sort of thing because then you realize like okay. So here's here's a here's a an example of why that's a good distillation when you talk about systematic injustice, you can say okay. Well, the prison system is is based on instinct right? It is based on a human instinct to punish and banish people that you perceive as transgressing against your tribe. And that alone allows you to really infer why there are things such as systematic abuses of the prison system. But also that core truth can then apply to everything whether it's policing the the legal system the judicial system even the history of America versus other nations and you see like oh, well the reason that concentration camps existed was because again There was a perceived transgression by certain groups against another group and so then you systematically banish and oppress them. So basically concentration camps are an extreme form of prison but it's responding to the same underpinning instincts. So that is what I mean by iterative refinement is once you have those key insights and then you can use them they are incredibly useful tools in your mental toolbox, but they're also simple and easy to use. Complex tools are harder to use. So like in this picture, you've got a file, a metal file is a very useful tool and you can use it on any number of things. Okay. Metacognitive skills. So metacognitive skills apply to a lot of different things, but there are a few, there are these three metacognitive skills that are absolutely critical to the process of distillation. So number one is knowledge integration. And so basically this is what I've been talking about is awareness of what you know. So if you have a mental index or a categorical understanding of what you know, you can also at least be aware of the categories and topics that you don't know. And so then you can use that ability to triangulate and infer like, okay, what don't I know about this? And then that allows you to go and systematically and strategically learn the things that you don't know. And so this is a, there are many behaviors. So strategic learning is one behavior, information foraging is another, because if information foraging is basically you go on a fishing expedition to find new information, you don't necessarily know what information you need, but you know that you need new information. And so information foraging and strategic learning are really critical to this process of distillation because there's probably some key insight out there that you can get from a different discipline or a body of knowledge that you're not familiar with. And once you get that key insight, your brain actually has a unique signal called the Eureka signal where it's like, that's what I was looking for. That's exactly what I'm getting chills just thinking about it because that's what kind of nerd I am. But you know that sensation that I'm talking about and that's what you're looking for when you're information foraging. And then once your brain gives you that signal, like, yes, this is what I was looking for, this answers all the problems, this helps simplify the framework. That is what I mean by knowledge integration, and that is a metacognitive skill where you learn to pay attention to those internal signals. Because again, your brain is what allows you to do all of this. And so, first and foremost, you need to pay attention to your brain. It was funny reading Dune where, I think it was in the third book, where he talks about the process of what it feels like to be a mentat. And this is what Frank Herbert was actually trying to describe, but of course this was like 60 years ago. so he didn't have the language that we have today to really describe the metacognitive processes going on. And so yes, this is mentat training. Mental models. The second thing is mental models, which is the deliberate construction, utilization, and refinement of your cognitive frameworks, your definitions, and your mental tools. So again, your brain, like whatever it is capable of and whatever it is not capable of, those are underpinning neurological abilities that you may or may not be conscious of. And of course, if something just doesn't exist in your brain, you can't be conscious of it. And so, even if you're vaguely aware of a tool that you might need or a gap in your knowledge, it already exists in your brain. It's just not refined or not fleshed out. So again, being aware of how your brain works and these mental models and these cognitive tools, very, very critical because it's not just about identifying knowledge that you need, it's also about identifying metacognitive tools that you might need or metacognitive tools that you might need, or metacognitive tools that you need to polish and refine and make better. And so this is what I mean by mental models. And this is the ability to make distal connections, for instance, between concepts. And if you go back to what I was talking about with cross-pollination, this is a metacognitive process that will just kind of automatically make you better at some of these things, but we'll get to the last one in just a moment, which is self-reflection. So reflection is about taking the time to just think about things, to mentally experiment with the knowledge that you have, the concepts that you have, the tools. And one thing that I didn't add into this description, but that is really important, is making those connections. So when I talk about distal connections, this is one of the key purposes of self-reflection, is finding those insights that are already in your brain. And so what I mean by this is, you know how if you're talking to like chat GPT or Claude or any of the chatbots out there, how like it knows a lot about this other thing and then it knows a lot about this other thing. And then if you manually connect the dots, it's like you almost see the Eureka signal in the language model where it's like, oh yeah, that's a really insightful way of talking about this. So this is, self-reflection is about making those connections between latent information that's in your brain and again this is also seems like it's how language models work. And so once you make those distal connections between different disciplines or things that feel distant, because sometimes things feel distant, they feel cognitively distant just because you don't have the mental frameworks and so it's like, okay well the scaffolding, there's a gap in the scaffolding so you have to go like way around to make the connection But then once you come back around you realize actually those two topics were not particularly far apart Or they weren't as different as you thought Anyways, the entire point here is that using your own brain is an entire set of skills get good at using your own brain It's also really really the only tool that you have All right. The next thing is incubation period so incubation period this is actually a cognitive neuroscience term And it is scientifically validated But this is the subconscious mental processes that that happen while you're not consciously working on a problem So you take in a bunch of information? mental processes that happen while you're not consciously working on a problem. So you take in a bunch of information, you think about it, and then you just set it down. You put it on the back burner and you ignore it. Pretty much every developer and technologist is aware of this, and there's other disciplines, but pretty much you talk to any developer and it's like, man, I was working on this problem all week and then I didn't think about it at all all weekend And then I you know came in first thing Monday morning and the answer was just there So there is lots and lots of empirical evidence that your brain continues to work on things in the background and in fact Depending on who you ask it seems like up to 90% of our cognition is unconscious So that means that that the that the the conscious effort that you put in, that's only 10% of what your brain is capable of. The rest, you just put it all in, you put in all the raw ingredients, you develop the skills, the reflection, and then you let it happen in the background. This is another thing that Frank Herbert talked about when he described being a mentat, was that you just let the calculation happen in the background. Very insightful guy, did lots of drugs. Let's see, so the end result of knowing about and deliberately utilizing incubation period is that you'll get unexpected insight solutions surfacing unexpectedly. I said unexpected too many times there. Anyways, this is a critical component to creativity and problem solving. Make deliberate use of this. So again, this is a metacognitive skill, knowing that incubation period is a thing and deliberately making use of it. So for instance, when I'm working on these slide decks, if I get to a part where it's like, you know what, it's just not working, and then I'll just walk away for a day, a week, however long it takes until the incubation period. And it's like, you know, ding, and the cake is done baking. So then I take it out. I'm like, Oh yeah, this looks much better. And then I come back to it and then the ideas are distilled and I can communicate them very clearly. So what I'll say is that for me, and I don't know if this is universal, but time and nature exercise and socializing are the best ways to distract myself while the incubation period is happening. Some people go to movies, some people read books, some people play video games. Actually, playing video games is another good thing because it completely takes your brain away from the other problem that you were working on. So this is basically you have to like let it go. You know, let, let the dough proof on its own, let it bake. And you know, cause if you keep, keep poking it, you're not going to let the process work out naturally. Finally mastery through teaching. So this is actually something that people have commented on, like how good I am at communicating things. And that comes through practice. I've always been kind of a natural communicator, even before I started this. My wife tells me that I was always good at talking. But certainly it's gotten better since I started my YouTube career because now, literally the value that I give to you is entirely predicated on my ability to teach things clearly. And so mastery through teaching is about achieving a deeper understanding of a subject by systematically and rigorously organizing information and knowledge so that it is optimized for communication. Optimizing for communication is the key thing here. The act of preparing and conveying this information forces you to distill complex ideas to their core essence thereby enhancing clarity and coherence. In other words, it's harder to teach something if you don't already have mastery of it yourself. And so when I'm going through and making these slides, I have to think about, okay, what is the optimal way of organizing this information? What are the key points that I actually need to convey to you? And then how do I convey them so that I can imprint them on your mind? So the act of teaching is itself another set of skills and metacognitive skills and frameworks that allows you to better handle information and knowledge. So teaching things is actually a really good way to refine and distill them further. Also, when you think about the ways that someone can misunderstand things, this means that I have to mentally be thinking about my mental models, but also your mental models. So people have commented on like, oh, hey, like when I'm explaining something, I'll often stop and explain something more clearly because I have mental models of your mental models. So I have like holograms of other people's mental models so that I can understand the gaps in their understanding which means it's like, okay I'm gonna hand you the piece of the puzzle that you need right now And this is all this is all stuff that's that's discussed in teaching theory My ex-wife was a was a teacher. So these are like kitchen table conversations that we used to have But yeah, so teaching requires theory of mind, which is another valuable set of skills And as I just said, how do I imprint knowledge and models into another mind without having the Vulcan mind melt? And so the part of the teaching tool is building these slide decks. So by externalizing my knowledge and putting it in a linear format like this, where I use texts and images to kind of convey and imprint the idea. That's how I am able to convey so much information so quickly and it also achieves a level of stimulation that means that you don't get bored while you're listening and watching. Okay, so in summary there are just a few steps to distillation. First, systematically and strategically learn a lot. Systematic curiosity. Number two, deliberately get good at using your brain. This is the primary thing about distillation. Number three, constantly polish and refine everything that you know and everything you think you know and all the tools in your mental toolbox. Number four, boil it down to the core essence. Number five, extract the hard kernel of truth. This is the elegantly simple aspect. And number six, communicate it to others. Communicating mastery through teaching is actually is in a critical, critical component. And so there's a number of ways you can do this. You can write about it on Reddit or medium or less wrong. This is a really good practice where it's like, okay, let me take the thing that I think that I know and communicate it to others. You are optimizing for clarity and aiming for elegant simplicity. This is how you achieve distillation. Thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed this video. Cheers, like, subscribe, et cetera, et cetera. Sign up on Patreon.
