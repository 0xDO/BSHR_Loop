{"text": " Morrison and Anthony Albanese are clashing over where the money is coming from. How will they fund billions of dollars worth of election promises? Today the Prime Minister detailed his economic blueprint for taxpayers, with Labor yet to reveal the full price of its policies. In the top end, crashing a very Australian card game. What are we playing today? A three way out. Oh shit! Oh shit! Is that right? Yeah! crashing a very Australian card game. What are we playing today? Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Is that right? Yeah. That's right. Well, we are in the territory. Known as Oh Hell elsewhere in the world, which might have been what Anthony Albanese was thinking here. Is there a problem with transparency here, Mr Albanese? Is there a problem with transparency here, Mr Albanese? You now just not giving me... Is this how you conduct press conferences? You have to answer eventually. Having dodged questions about is how you conduct press conferences. You have to answer eventually. Having dodged questions about his policy costings and whether his extra spending on childcare, skills, manufacturing and Medicare will increase debt and deficit. We will announce that on Thursday. There's no point announcing it now. I want you to be there on Thursday. What is Anthony Albanese hiding from? The answer is proper scrutiny. The Treasurer and Finance Minister releasing their own document. The Liberal and Nationalist plan for responsible economic management. Promising to save more than $2.5 billion over four years by cutting the public service, increasing the so-called efficiency dividend from 1.5 to 2 percent. It's a budget of three hundred and twenty seven point three billion dollars which is where we're seeking to shave 2.7 off on departmental expenses. Labor promises to cut three billion dollars from public service consultancies and contractors. We would be inheriting a debt trajectory at record levels. We take that challenge seriously. Today, Mr Albanese making another $1.5 billion promise, this one for medical manufacturing to boost the domestic supply of drugs. This government made $70 billion of announcements with no offsets. And says under Tony Abbott in opposition the coalition held back its costings the same way in 2013. Let's get real here. Using Tony Abbott as a model though does seem like an unusual ploy for a Labor leader, particularly one promising a higher standard of accountability and transparency. As former PM John Howard helps his former advisor Josh Frydenberg. You must be exhausted. I am tired. But the adrenaline keeps you going. And blood pressure might rise if tomorrow's wages figures show another effective cut rising below inflation, adding more pressure for another interest rate rise. That's no good. That's a gutter ball. But Thursday's jobs figures could show an unemployment rate in the threes, and for him, that would be right on target. And Mark Riley joins me once again. Mark, you have exclusive details on internal polling conducted by both sides. Yeah, tracking polling, Mark, that's used by Labor and the Coalition to chart sentiment across about 20 marginal seats around the country on a daily basis. The Coalition says that its track last night showed a strong increase in primary support among people who had already pre-polled, but at the same time, Labor says it found a strong rejection of the government's super homebuyers scheme. So what does that mean? When we have these competing results, it means that the parties are using information when and how they can to build momentum in the final phase of this campaign, but also that perhaps the election on Saturday might be just a bit closer than the published polls suggest. Mark. Mark Reilly in Sydney, thank you. Star candidates in key Sydney seats swooped on polling booths today, hoping to woo voters face to face as record numbers cast their ballot early. In Western Sydney, there has been an angry confrontation surrounding former Premier Christina Keneally, who's now the Labor candidate for Fowler. Hello, how are you? Hello, how are you? Hello, how are you? From west to east, north to south, the finish is in sight and every vote on the line. In south-west Sydney, Labor held Fowler, Christina Keneally up against Independent Dai Lei. A poll showing the former Premier not being from the area is hurting her vote. That's not the feedback we're getting at all. They know me from my time as Premier and they're excited to have the opportunity to have a voice at the centre of government. A lot of people actually remember her as the failed Premier of New South Wales and her links to Eddie O'Beat and George O'Pody. The lay campaign bristling at Labor signs showing her alongside Scott Morrison, her husband confronting a Labor staffer. There's a lot of lies going on here. They campaign bristling at Labor signs showing her alongside Scott Morrison, her husband confronting a Labor staffer. There's a lot of lies going on here. That's my wife, she's the Independent. Shouldn't you be ashamed of yourself to get it so wrong? In Wentworth, Liberal Dave Sharma, an Independent, Allegra Spender, today side by side and depending on the poll, could be neck and neck. Over the last three years people are saying the government is not listening to them in terms of climate, in terms of integrity. But they also want a government that's going to protect the jobs and livelihoods of Australians. They also want a government that's going to look after our national security. In Warringah, Independent Zali Stegall fending off controversial Liberal candidate Catherine Deves. The athlete in me knows you've never crossed the finish line until you've crossed it. While on the South Coast in Gilmore, former State Transport Minister Andrew Constance is facing an uphill battle to unseat Labor's Fiona Phillips. It's very serious issues that people are having to contend with. And I just think they don't want a gob full of politics. They've had enough of it. A growing sign of minds made up, the growing number of people voting early. More than 2.6 million so far, that's already more than at the same point during the 2019 election. It's a bit of a schmottle this year. And it's almost over. Paul Caddack, 7 News.
