{"text": " Hey everybody, David Shapiro here as promised with another video. Today's video is about purpose and meaning and answering the question why. So it'll be a nice light topic. I wanted to start off with a little bit of humor, but please, I promise that it will be very, very serious. This little clip comes from a TV show called Rick and Morty. If you're not familiar with it, it is about nihilism and the purposelessness of life. So in this case, a tiny little robot that Rick built drives across the table, says, what is my purpose? And Rick says, you pass the butter. The robot says, oh, my God. And Rick says, yeah, welcome to the club, pal. So basically he built a really intelligent little robot with one single purpose and it's somewhat meaningless or trivial. All right, so let's start getting a little bit serious. For some background, what do I mean by why and purpose and meaning? So we are a curious species. We ask why for biological and evolutionary reasons. What I mean by that is curiosity was an adaptive trait. It propelled us across continents, it helped us find new food, so on and so forth, but asking why, being curious, is dangerous and sometimes painful. It leads to dark places like why do we exist and what is our purpose? So basically my assertion is that our curiosity is the underpinning motivation or power behind purpose and meaning. We ask why why it needs answers now I'm gonna just say this up front. It is scientifically impossible or Sorry, it is impossible to objectively or scientifically prove why this is called the is-ought problem It's also sometimes called the orthogonality problem, which is that The way things are and the way things could be or the way things should be are completely unrelated. Things just are the way they are, and that is completely detached from any underpinning why, meaning, or purpose. So, with all that said, now what? So, curiosity is a double-edged sword. We have really big brains, and that's a mixed blessing. As I mentioned just a moment ago, curiosity is why we spread across the planet. We found new foods. We learned to make tools. The most dangerous part about asking questions is that they have answers, except sometimes they don't. Or rather, you might not like the answer that you get, because sometimes the answer is not definitive or concrete. Sometimes the answer is there is no clear answer or there is or otherwise it's not satisfying. So you know, they say, well, curiosity killed the cat and satisfaction brought it back. But sometimes asking questions always results in unsatisfying answers. And that is one of the core themes of this video. So we can ask questions. Great. We ask, why do we exist? we have creation myths or Cosmogonic cycles which describe either literally or metaphorically how existence came to be These are the origin myths like you know Big Bang Theory or God said let there be light or whatever Science attempts to do this with a little bit more rigor, but the underlying fact of the matter is we are compelled, like biologically, physically compelled to confabulate and imagine explanations for everything. So if you don't believe me, go look up what happens with certain brain disorders, particularly around strokes or some kinds of injuries, where one part of your brain is constantly just trying to come up with explanations. Literally entirely one half of your brain is just imagining possibilities. The other half is trying to keep it anchored in some sort of logic coherent sense-based reality. But we are really great at just imagining what it is that we're seeing or why. We can systematically collect evidence and concoct beliefs that we call theories but everything, religion and science, is just a collection of beliefs. So as I've studied epistemology, philosophy, science, and everything else, I've distilled it down to there are three pillars for all belief structures, whether it's science or anything else. It's beliefs plus evidence plus consensus. So you might have a set of beliefs, you know, you might believe the Big Bang is how and why things were created. But even if you ask a physicist, they say, no, this isn't a creation myth, this is just an event that happened that we have some evidence of. Beliefs and evidence and then consensus. Do people agree? Now, in the case of religion, you get consensus by having a shared document, which is not that much different from a theory. I hate to say it, but the Bible is a theory, right? And I don't believe in it, right? But there are plenty of people that do. Just like the theory of relativity, theory of evolution, so on and so forth. Now, the difference, I can already hear the hardcore atheists and scientists out there saying, yeah, but science does tend to be a lot more rigorous. However, and so I tend to believe more in science. However, any good scientist will tell you, you always have to make a lot of assumptions and we'll talk about assumptions later in this video. And the scientific community and scientific minds are no less subject to dogmatic thinking. Try and challenge a scientist's way of thinking, they will fight you tooth and nail and they will get vicious about it. So all that being said, no satisfying or conclusive answer has been found. Period. We may never know why we exist or why the universe exists. And in that space, in that doubt and uncertainty, that's where the debate happens. Now, we might find an answer that is satisfying, we might come to consensus, but we also have to entertain the possibility that we may never understand. So we're caught between a rock and a hard place. It is our nature to ask why, to wonder. And yet, some answers may never come, or they may never be satisfying. And so in the case of religion, I did just say that the Bible is a theory, the Bible is a theory, the Quran is a theory, all religious texts are a theory because it is a set of beliefs with some evidence presented and there is consensus around it, just like the Big Bang Theory and every other scientific theory. However, the underpinning assertion in many religions is, basically boils down to, because God said so. And because we're super curious, that answer doesn't really cut it anymore. It is a deeply unsatisfying answer. That schism, that disconnect, that being caught between a rock and a hard place and the lack of satisfying rigor is at the heart of nihilism. And nihilism says, since no meaning can be empirically or objectively derived maybe there is no meaning there must be no meaning so the underlying assumption behind nihilism though is that empiricism is good right and valuable but maybe it isn't maybe empiricism is not all that it's cracked up to be and neither is religion. So we're even more lost than ever before. I know that I'm not helping yet and don't worry, we will get there. I'm just unpacking how lost we are and why the question of meaning and purpose is such a difficult problem to answer. It is actually entirely possible that it is the hardest question that any of us will ever contend with. So I've set the stage. There are lots of schools of thought. Like I said, there's a distance between what we can collect evidence for and the rigor and what remains unknown and uncertain. And in that space there are way, way, way too many possibilities. So one is the possibility of the divine, hypercosmic entities. And I'll unpack each one of these in coming slides. I just want to give you a preview of what we're about to talk about. Number two, materialism and natural law, objectivism. Number two, materialism and natural law, objectivism. Number three, dualism, the mind-body problem. Number four, panpsychism and solipsism. Solipsism is the idea that maybe I am the only thing that is real and everything else is just my dream or hallucination. Realism from a physics standpoint, objectivism, which is slightly different from materialism as a philosophical point. The anthropic principle, the idea that maybe the universe actually is for us and it's also possible that the universe exists because of us. It's a very difficult chicken or the egg problem. Which comes first. Number eight, emergence. Maybe all the complexity that we have, consciousness, gravity, life, all of that emerges from underlying chaos. And then finally other ideas like the simulation hypothesis. Some of these are going to be woven in. Okay, hypercosmic entities, gods, deities, that sort of thing. If they exist and they're unfalsifiable, then they are likely to be hypercosmic. And what I mean by that is outside or above the universe. If gods exist, then we are likely contained inside our own fishbowl of reality that the gods created and by definition we can't get out of that fishbowl. To the goldfish looking through the glass wall, it might see that there's a greater world out there, but it won't comprehend it and it certainly won't be able to access it. If we are contained like that and the gods are able to reach into our environment and abide by rules that we don't understand, it's entirely possible that they exist, but we will never be able to interact with them on our terms. So the fact that we can even conceive of this possibility begs its own questions. Why is it that our brains are capable of conceptualizing this? Some people will say, ah, well, obviously we're able to conceive of this stuff because God wills it. That's an unfalsifiable idea. It is one idea and is one possibility. For many of us, it's not satisfying. It's still a very real possibility. I contend with this possibility all the time. Materialism is pretty much the polar opposite. Materialism says that matter and energy explain everything. There is nothing outside of, quote, natural law. Basically this presumes that everything in the fishbowl that we see is all that there is to reality and there's nothing outside the fishbowl of our reality. Now one natural consequence of this assertion that matter and energy is all that exists is the possibility of panpsychism. So basically if there's no such thing as a soul, if there's no such thing as metaphysics, then how do we possess phenomenal consciousness? And phenomenal consciousness is the subjective experience of being. Because if all that we are made of is crude matter and energy, then at what point do we go from conscious to unconscious? Now, as a living breathing entity, do we go from conscious to unconscious? Now as a living breathing entity, you can go from conscious to unconscious if you're hit in the head, if you die, if you fall asleep. So phenomenal consciousness seems to be an ephemeral state. But the ability to even be conscious might be an intrinsic property of matter and energy. If that is true, then could rocks be conscious? Does everything have a subjective sense of being if in fact consciousness is potentially an intrinsic quality of matter? It quickly becomes very uncomfortable to explore these ramifications because if my experience right now of sitting here looking at the camera talking to an electronic device and sometime in the future you the viewer listening to me watching me is all just matter and energy just interactions what else does that mean? Does that mean any sufficiently sophisticated matter and energy system could be conscious? What about machines? What about squid, dogs, trees? I'm not saying one way or another, just elucidating possibilities. And again, possibilities that are darn near impossible to test. Dualism. Dualism is a midway point between divine metaphysics and materialism. Dualism says that maybe consciousness and matter or the mind and body are two actually separate entities that merely interact in the context of our body. To me, dualism just sounds like an attempt to philosophize a soul. So I just say soul. The idea of dualism is incredibly old. It dates back to Babylon and ancient Egypt. Then of course it has been revitalized and talked about in modern times by western philosophy, but it has also been deeply influenced, let's say, by the Judeo-Christian tradition. So it's kind of like, all right, well our understanding of this today is deeply colored by understanding of this today is deeply colored by by holy scriptures and other interpretations and then solipsism is an extension of this which says okay maybe my mind is the only thing that's real because that's the only thing I can observe and if that's true maybe no one else is real, but also this becomes deeply uncomfortable and deeply problematic very quickly. Realism, now we're getting into physics, or objectivism. I actually asked chat GPT to write this description for me just because I knew that it would do a better job of summarizing it, so I'll just read it. Realism in the context of physics and objectivism is the view that the physical world exists independently of our perceptions and observations of it, and that there are objective facts and properties that can be studied and understood through scientific inquiry. Realists believe that scientific theories provide an accurate and reliable description of the physical world and that there is a single objective truth to be discovered through scientific investigation. However, the measurement problem in quantum mechanics presents a challenge to the realist perspective. According to quantum mechanics, the behavior of subatomic particles can only be described in terms of probabilities rather than realistic perspective. According to quantum mechanics, the behavior of subatomic particles can only be described in terms of probabilities, rather than definitive outcomes. When a measurement is made on a quantum system, its state is said to collapse into one of many possible states, with the probability of each outcome being determined by a wave function. This presents a challenge to the realist perspective, as it suggests the act of measurement itself is what determines the outcome of an experiment, rather than the underlying physical properties of the system being studied. This has led to some physicists and philosophers to adopt alternative interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, the many-worlds interpretation, and the transactional interpretation, in order to reconcile the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics with the realist perspective of classical physics. In other words, our existence and the act of observing reality seems to modify it. This stands in stark contrast to the idea of a single objective truth. The idea that we are just agents that happen to be walking upon the playground of reality. But instead it seems that us looking at reality modifies it. It should be important to know that the physics, the Nobel Prize in physics last year, went to a group that proved that reality is non-real, at least at a certain level. However, if the underlying substrate of our reality is non-real, but we are convinced that it is real and solid and deterministic those could be emergent properties based upon underlying mechanisms. It's a lot to unpack we'll touch on it a little bit more but I just wanted to point out that there's a lot of nuance here. So I did just mention emergence. It's entirely possible that the universe is just made of math and quantum noise. Maybe it's a simulation. If so, who is running the simulation and why? This basically goes back to the goldfish bowl analogy. If the universe is a quantum simulation, and we are contained inside of that simulation, if we're contained inside of the fish bowl, that implies that there is something outside the fish bowl looking in. And it could be, by design, we will never be able to look outside the fish bowl. So again, we're left at square one with no answers, no explanations, only possibilities. Now another way of interpreting this rather than going the simulation route is that if the universe is just math and quantum noise and everything that we are and think simply emerged from underlying complexity and underlying systems. If reality and the universe is layered, that still doesn't give us any satisfactory answer as to why we're here and what our purpose is. It in fact could speak to the nihilistic idea that there is no intrinsic purpose. We are just a mathematical dividend. But again, that's deeply unsatisfying. And as a organism, as a being that craves answers and understanding, we have to keep asking. So, if you're having a mild existential crisis, don't worry, I understand why, and we will pull you through to the end and it will get better, I promise. So let's do a quick recap as to where we are. Everything that I just shared with you proves that no amount of inquiry can determine why so far. That might change in the future, but it might not. Perhaps this state of uncertainty is permanent. We may have to learn to live with unsatisfying answers. In order to derive any assertion of why or meaning or purpose, we have to make certain assumptions about what is true. We can adopt multiple schools of thought. We can say maybe the universe is created by hypercosmic entities. Maybe it just emerges from chaos. Maybe it's a little bit of all of the above. Whatever it happens to be, we could make assumptions. But what if we let go of the need for those answers, the need for those assumptions? What if we question our ability, or sorry, our need for purpose and meaning? We might do that but again it's in our nature to be curious so why suppress our nature? Let's see where this goes. One possibility is what's so called optimistic nihilism which takes everything that I just said and says ah ah, we cannot derive any purpose. Scientifically impossible. You said so, Dave. There is no meaning. There is no purpose. So I am free to make it for myself. Well, yes and no. This ignores our potential biological purpose. It also ignores the social reality that we are a social species, that also ignores our nature. So nihilism in this case is predicated on the detached model of a mind floating in a vacuum. We are not floating in a vacuum. We are part and parcel of a very complex system. Optimistic nihilism is also overly individualistic and again fails to take into the context of the fact that we once didn't exist, we do now, and we predict that we won't exist in the future. But rather than rationalizing it, rather than engaging with nihilism in a cerebral manner, with pure logic, it just doesn't feel right. And if logic and science can't provide answers, maybe feelings are more valid. Maybe they're equally valid. Nihilism is not helpful and it offers no guidance. We humans thrive on challenge, meaning, and purpose, and we want satisfaction, whatever it looks like. We derive so much satisfaction from getting conclusive answers or learning to live with the uncertainty. Nihilism, therefore, is a dead end. Another possibility is that form follows function. This actually comes from architecture, by the way. But maybe our purpose can be inferred from our form. But maybe our purpose can be inferred from our form. Maybe since we can't scientifically prove, it's not written in the stars anywhere, this is why we exist, this is our purpose, this is our meaning. Maybe we can guess at our purpose based on our form. Now, we have really big brains. Our brains cogitate, we ask why, we're very curious. Our brains are disproportionately large and expensive compared to other species. So maybe we can infer some of our purpose from this fact. Maybe we are meant to think. Maybe our purpose is to ask why and to seek information, to look for understanding. We make tools. It's not entirely unique in the animal kingdom, in the universe, but our tools are far and away the most sophisticated tools. Maybe that's part of our purpose. We have the highest levels of manual dexterity, fine motor control. Again, it's possible that that's part of our purpose. We have the highest levels of manual dexterity, fine motor control. Again, it's possible that that's part of our purpose. When you look at our function, we are problem solvers. We are storytellers. We are lovers and fighters and liars. We are the most glorious and messy creature out there. It's possible that this is our purpose. Whatever else you might believe, whether you're looking at scientific evidence or spiritual evidence, it can be pretty easy to come to the conclusion or at least the assumption that we are special. As far as we can tell, life is extraordinarily rare in the universe. The phenomenon of consciousness appears to be even more rare. Whether or not we were here on purpose, whether we were created by some hypercosmic entity running a simulation, whether or not the universe accidentally discovered us in the universal wave function, and the rest of the universe collapsed around us with the strong anthropic principle, maybe it doesn't matter. We are here now. Maybe it doesn't matter. We are here now. I've collected here a few quotations that I have found particularly helpful in finding meaning and purpose for myself. The purpose of life is a life of purpose. It's sort of a tautology, but it helped me. It's food for thought. The two most important days of your life are the day you're born and the day you find out why. And we'll talk more about that in the next slide. But that's Mark Twain, one of the most gifted and acerbic thinkers in American history. The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away. I really like that one. Success is liking yourself, liking what you do, and liking how you do it. Maya Angelou. Also an incredible, incredible thinker. The most important thing is to enjoy your life, to be happy. It's all that matters. Maybe logic doesn't matter. Or maybe it doesn't matter as much. The purpose of our lives is to be happy. The Dalai Lama. The greatest glory in living lies not in never failing, but in rising every time we fall. Nelson Mandela time we fall. Nelson Mandela. So here are some tips that I have on finding your purpose. You might have heard it called different things but in my reading and studying and reflection and conversation it's all referring to the same thing. Higher purpose, your true self, your soul's mission, your raison d'etre, I'm probably saying that wrong, I have a hard time pronouncing French, the genius myth, your highest aspiration, your ikigai, which we'll talk more about in the next slide, or your true calling. Why? Maybe why doesn't matter. We can't figure it out, so maybe it doesn't. Your purpose was probably there from your childhood and it's probably more of a feeling than something that you can articulate or put in concrete terms. One thing to keep in mind about your purpose is that it is probably not what society or your family pressed on to you. For instance, become a doctor is probably not your life's purpose. Become a lawyer, become a NFL star. However, heal people very well could be your life's purpose. And if that's the case, then becoming a doctor is just one potential means to that end. What I have found is that generally your purpose can be articulated in two words, a verb and a noun, or sometimes an adjective. My purpose, which I knew from a very young age, but it took me a long time to articulate it, is to solve problems. That's what I do. Whether it's AI or technology or philosophy or social or mental or whatever, I am a problem solver. That is my purpose. Write truth. That's my fianc\u00e9's purpose, which she recently figured out how to articulate. Bring joy. I have known people whose primary goal in life was to bring joy. I've known other people whose primary purpose, one of my good friends who moves around a lot so I don't see him very often. His primary purpose seems to be explore movement. Alignment is a concept that my fiance actually introduced me to. And it is quite simply how close or far you are from your purpose. Another word for alignment is the Tao, the way, which is the philosophy of Taoism. If you're in alignment with your purpose, then life just gets easier. And if you're out of alignment, life just gets harder and harder and harder. The Tao is just one way of articulating it. The Greeks called it the fates. There's plenty of other terms for it. Some people say that God's plan, that's another way of thinking about it. God's plan is ineffable. I don't necessarily believe that it's ineffable, but it can be very mysterious. One of the last slides is the concept of Ikigai. So as you probably know, I am a big fan of Eastern philosophy. Japan has figured out a lot of stuff, and they figured it out a long time ago. Ikigai is the concept. This is how we have articulated in the West. I don't know if this is exactly how the Japanese articulated. But make a Venn diagram. There's four fields. What you love, what you excel at, what you can make money doing, and what the world needs. The confluence of those four things is your purpose. That's what ikigai means. It roughly translates to the exact same of purpose in life, the reason for being. When I first discovered the concept of ikigai, I wrote it in permanent marker on my desk about 16 years ago and I looked at that word every day for many years. Now even though this is a very simple formula, simple diagram, it can take years to articulate and distill your ikigai, so don't rush it. In conclusion, overall recap, oh, I forgot to put Ikigai at the bottom, I apologize. Ignore that. Any universal declaration of meaning and purpose is intrinsically flawed, impossible, and otherwise totally useless or unsatisfying. It is premature and deeply unsatisfying to conclude therefore that there is no meaning or purpose. The reason is because there are just simply too many possibilities. I articulated a dozen different philosophical and scientific possibilities that all leave room for why, that leave room for meaning and purpose. But, while you can't declare what they are, we can infer that meaning and purpose appear to be a process of discovery, or an individual and collective journey that we're all on together and in some respects on our own.
