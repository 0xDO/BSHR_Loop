{"text": " Hey everybody, David Shapiro here with today's video. We are going to talk about disconnecting, or in other words, throw your phone out the window. Before we get started, I don't want to disrupt the flow of things, so I'm just going to plug my Patreon real quick. My videos presently get about 2,000 hours of watch time per day. All of it ad free. So if you find it in your heart, try and support me. Every little bit helps. The higher tiers will unlock the privilege of chatting with me. And I'm happy to talk about AI jobs, philosophy, whatever. There are just a couple of constraints. I don't sign NDAs and there are a few NDAs that I have to respect, a few business interests that I have to respect but most things are topics that I can cover. So also before we get started I want to share Sorrel Amore. I'm a big fan of hers, and her Free Human project is incredibly relevant to everything that I am trying to achieve. So I encourage people to pause my video and watch at least these last two, but really I've watched all three of these videos multiple times. She is doing the same thing that I'm doing. We're just taking it from a different perspective. So the more perspectives you get, the better you'll understand. So I asked my community what they wanted to see because I recorded before this video, I tried and recorded two different versions and I couldn't quite figure it out. I needed help. I needed the hive mind. I needed the community to tell me what it is that they needed. That helped me frame this video. This is actually merging several topics based on getting the juices flowing. Let's dive right in. I broke my phone. I was going to see Ant-Man, Quantumania, a few days ago and I dropped my phone in the parking lot and it pinwheeled. It rolled down the parking lot. It was almost comical. It felt like divine intervention. It rolled much further than you'd think a phone should be able to. And it refused to turn on again after that. Ever since then, I've been way more present and grounded. Even on the way home, I rolled the windows down in my car, I noticed the traffic around me, the sun, the wind, the sounds, the smells, everything seemed more still and more real. And one thing that I realized is that you need your smartphone way less than you think. For music, you can either go without or switch to the radio. For navigation, you can check directions before you leave. For calendars, you can again just check on the computer every now and then, unless you don't have a computer. That's one thing. For timers, I use my oven timer now. I use my oven timer to remind me of when it's time to leave or when it's time to jump on meetings. And what I quickly realized is that going without is not a big deal. I've had this fantasy for a while of getting rid of my smartphone permanently and living by solar time. So look at the, look at the sun. Um, I have very few clocks in my house already. I stopped wearing my Fitbit. I don't wanna know what time it is. I don't even wanna know what day it is. And I know that there's privilege wrapped up in that, and we'll talk about that in a minute. But this has been a critical lesson, and like I said, it felt like divine intervention, and looking back, I of think that it was. Now, this is just me talking about my life, but what happens when society changes? That's why I'm doing what I'm doing. It's the entire reason for my YouTube channel. AI is coming and jobs are going away. That's all there is to it. I posted a article recently on LinkedIn and Twitter that chat GPT is already replacing jobs and it's only going to accelerate. So one of the things that someone asked in the comments was what happens to our attention span and our learning? With technology our attention span is eight seconds. For web browsing it's actually closer to about two seconds. You click on a link you have about two seconds to determine whether or not you even care what's on that web page. What happens to our identity as society changes, as technology changes our landscape? So for the sake of this video, I am making the assumption that one, AI doesn't kill everyone, which I'm working on that as well. Two, we don't end up in a dystopian cyberpunk hellscape where corporate greed drives everything. And three, that we do end up in some sort of utopia as yet defined. So what do we do then? How are we going to change. So, Sorel's Free Human project is a phenomenal starting point and her approach is to interview people that have achieved this level of freedom and using their experiences to articulate what it means. Um, so some of the things that we've seen so far, just in those first three videos, one is financial independence and it doesn't quite mean what you think it means. Sorel is herself a millionaire, but many of the people that she interviews are not, I am not, I'm not going to tell you how much money I have to my name, but it's not that much. I'm not going to tell you how much money I have to my name, but it's not that much. Social autonomy is another ingredient. What I mean by social autonomy is breaking free of social expectations and social controls. The third ingredient is alternative lifestyles, so basically getting away from the 9 to 5, getting away from the white picket fence of the American dream. And the fourth main ingredient is following your Dharma or alignment or your soul's path. It's all the same thing, just different different names for the same thing. Now there are a few barriers to achieving this. So one is just social pressure to conform. Sorrel posted on Twitter about how much grief she gets from some people because she's disrupting the status quo. There's also a lack of understanding how. The idea of living differently is so alien and foreign that people just don't even know where to begin, which is a big reason that she's doing her project and another reason that I'm doing mine. I call mine post nihilism. She calls it being a free human, same thing, same exact thing. Another big barrier is fear, fear of the unknown. And then finally accepting a different standard of living. And so this is why I put an asterisk by financial independence. When you let go of the things that you don't need, you need way less. So for my entire adult life, my standard of living has been about $40,000 a year. When I quit my day job, I made more than twice what I needed, so I saved most of my money. I was on that treadmill of that grind, and I was like, why? I don't actually care. Only because it was the default path. So when I said, you know what, I live way below my means, so I'm going to live more in accordance with how I want to and let things go. Let someone else have that day job if they want it. So I am an autistic systems thinker. So rel is a censor. That's fine. We're different people. So she's engaging with the lived experience of people and I am going to analyze the shit out of this. So let's unpack it. One of the first things that you need to know or learn about is the concept of asceticism. Asceticism refers to the practice of severe self-discipline and self-denial, often for religious or spiritual reasons, in order to achieve a higher state of consciousness or purity. This can include practices such as fasting, celibacy, living in solitude, and avoiding luxury or material possessions. Asceticism is found in many religions and belief systems including Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. Asceticism is found in many religions and belief systems including Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. It is about minimalism of experience. The second concept that you need to know is Aestheticism. Aestheticism is an artistic and philosophical movement that emerged in the late 19th century which emphasizes the importance of beauty and aesthetic values in art and life. It advocates for the pursuit of beauty and pleasure above all else and rejects moral or political themes as unnecessary in art. Aesthetes seek to create and appreciate art solely for its own sake, without concern for its social or practical function. The movement is closely associated with the decadent and symbolist movements in literature and has influenced various forms of art, including painting, sculpture, literature, and design. In other words, it is about maximalism of experience. This influences Western culture through to this day, and this is embedded in our advertising landscape. We synthesize, we fabricate the need for products, goods, services, and experiences. And we put the people who achieve those up on a pedestal. That's why I picked this image of an attractive woman, you know, implied naked, looking out over probably an Italian, French, or Mediterranean ocean. The idea is if you don't have that, you are incomplete. It's not true. Another concept is Taoism. So there's two primary components of Taoism. One is about balance, hence the yin-yang as the primary symbol of Taoism. But it's also about alignment with the way. And alignment with the way is pretty similar to some branches of Christianity, the idea of going along with God's ineffable plan. I've read the Tao Te Ching and the way that it describes the way it is a natural flow of the world that you can't fight. It doesn't ever ascribe it to one big God deity but it does say, you know, the heavens, the universe, whatever, the cosmos has its own power, its own course. And what you need to do is you need to align yourself with that energy. It's pretty identical to the concept of Dharmaharma which which says that you have a purpose for being here and that if you align with your dharma things will go better things will get easier east west doesn't matter india japan china america europe whatever your spiritual disposition is whatever your philosophical disposition is, whatever your philosophical disposition is, this concept keeps arising all over the world. In Zen, Zen is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism that emphasizes the direct experience of enlightenment through meditation and the cultivation of awareness in daily life. Zen emphasizes the importance of living in the present moment and encourages practitioners to let go of attachment to thoughts, concepts, and desires. Zen also emphasizes the importance of working with a teacher or master and often incorporates elements of art, poetry, and ritual into its practice. Zen has had a significant impact on many aspects of Japanese culture, including art, literature, and the tea ceremony. Wabi-sabi is something that I've been learning about recently. Zen is something that I practiced and studied more than 10 years ago. Wabi-sabi is a Japanese aesthetic and worldview, I need to emphasize worldview, it's not just a philosophy, it is an entire way of being that values the beauty of imperfection, impermanence, and the natural world. It is often associated with traditional Japanese arts such as the tea ceremony, pottery, and garden design. Wabi-sabi emphasizes the acceptance of the transience and decay of all things and values the beauty that arises from the unique characteristics and flaws of an object or environment. Wabi-sabi encourages simplicity, modesty, and a deep appreciation for the natural world and the passing of time. And the reason that I picked My Neighbor Totoro is because this film, above many others, emphasizes this value of wabi-sabi. And it is actually why slice of life is a genre in Japan. Because of the cultural beliefs that Japan has around just appreciating existence. That is why there are so many of these aesthetic films that don't really have a purpose. Kiki's Delivery Service is another example. Meditation. There are many kinds of meditation. Vipassana, Anapanasati, Satipatthana. Mindfulness is the most popular. It's about connecting with and accepting everything in your mind and body without judgment, without resistance. And the science is in. Mindfulness is basically magic. It increases your health across the board. It lowers your blood pressure, increases all kinds of measurements of well-being, reduces your suffering, reduces anxiety, depression, guilt, shame. It yields better cognition, memory, and sleep. It also creates higher emotional intelligence, empathy, and awareness. creates higher emotional intelligence, empathy, and awareness. One final concept is Ichigo-ichi. Ichigo-ichi is a Japanese term that translates to one time, one meeting, or once in a lifetime. It is a concept that emphasizes the fleeting nature of life and the importance of cherishing each moment and encounter as unique and irreplaceable. The term is often associated with Japanese tea ceremony, where each gathering is seen as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to share a moment of harmony and connection with others. Ichigo-ichi can be seen as a reminder to live in the present moment and to appreciate the beauty and impermanence of life. Now, did you spot the common themes? Give you a moment just to think. Pause the video if you want. Radical acceptance. And I picked this cartoon just because it's hilarious. It's a very Western approach. Radical acceptance is a psychological concept that involves fully accepting and embracing reality without trying to change or resist it. It involves acknowledging and accepting what is happening in the present moment without judgment or attempts to control the situation. Radical acceptance is often used in therapy to help individuals cope with a difficult or painful experience, and is seen as a way to reduce suffering and increase resilience. It can also as a way to reduce suffering and increase resilience. It can also be a way to cultivate a more mindful and nonjudgmental approach to life. Radical acceptance is a Western synthesis of all these Eastern ideas. It is also a way to live. And minimalism. Let go of everything you don't actually need. This was the underpinning inspiration of Marie Kondo. Let go of people, money, and things that you don't need. Let go of jobs, expectations, and beliefs that you don't need. Challenge the assumptions of what you need. Appreciate what you've got, and don't ask any experience to be more than it is. And also, this is not strictly an Eastern idea. Epicurus said the same thing. Remain present in every experience. And do less. It's okay. It takes a while to figure out. It took me weeks. Wu-wei is the Taoist idea of not doing. Pursue less, compete less, it doesn't matter. Who cares? Let nature run its course. It's going to anyways. So having worked at becoming this, what's it like? I took this picture a few months ago as the world started to cool down and just the sun coming directly at me over the treetops Backlighting the trees lighting up the fog. I Said this is a perfect moment and I had my phone with me. So I took a picture, you know That's what we do. We have the Instagram culture. I didn't post it anywhere though. I Kept it So that I could remind myself of this moment I kept it so that I could remind myself of this moment. And that's all there is to it. It's just a matter of stopping and recognizing these moments. And you don't have to record them. You don't have to perform them. You don't have to share them. So, to answer the original question, what's going to change? Here are some of my predictions. Not on the individual level. The individual level is up to everyone. And again, I urge you to watch Sorrel's videos because she very much talks about the individual experience and finding your unique path. you to watch Sorrel's videos, because she very much talks about the individual experience and finding your unique path. But on a macro scale, what will change? So first, education today requires us to ignore our natural instincts and curiosity, and instead pursue arbitrary, trivial, and menial tasks. Why? Because it's got to prepare us for our jobs. That's all there is to it. The industrial model of education is about preparing children to accept that they're gonna get graded on things that they don't care about. And then this pattern persists throughout the rest of our lives. And that paradigm will go away. We will change away from what do you do? Meaning what is your occupation to what do you care about? What do you do for fun? I write, I hike, I sing in the shower. There's a few other things I won't mention. But that's what I do. I solve problems, I do AI. I don't actually care. I do AI because it satisfies my ikigai, which is the Japanese concept of your reason for being. Ikigai is the intersection of that which you love, that which you're good at, that which you can get paid for, and that which society needs. That's just how you find an occupation. That's just how you make ends meet. That's not what I actually care about. Not really. I know part of Ikigai is do what you love, and I do love AI. I find it fascinating. But how I actually live on a day-to-day basis is different. Life will slow down in all ways. Every concept that I just shared predominantly from a Indian and Japanese culture is all about appreciating the moment. And what you will realize as you start to engage with this life, this new way of living is that so much of our convenience is based on toxic productivity? Having a smartphone with you at all times having Being completely saturated by electronics music movies TVs porn, whatever When you start to let that stuff go you realize who cares so what and it's about the realization that we can just unpack so much baggage from our toxic culture so i'll leave you with one final message be yourself that's all there is to it thanks for watching Be yourself. That's all there is to it.
