{"text": " There's some rough, rough areas outside of DC. Yeah, everybody should go to the ghetto. I was taken to the ghetto one time, that's the worst. When you get taken and you're not expecting to go. Usually you want to know when you're going to the ghetto, like I'm going to see some wild shit, I got to prepare myself, I'm going to see something crazy. When you're taken, it's different. I had a limousine driver. It was after a show, it was late at night, it was like three in the morning. I had a limousine driver, he was shows late at night it's like 3 in the morning and I had a limousine driver he's a nice guy talking to me and shit oh hey where you from dawg? DC?

At three o'clock in the morning. I didn't know he was taking me to the ghetto at first. I started looking out the window, I was like, what the fuck, gun store, gun store, liquor store, gun store, where the fuck he taking me? This don't look good. He didn't say shit. Just pulled up in front of an old rickety building that looked like a project. Now, I'd never been there before, I'm not sure if it was a project, but it certainly had all the familiar symptoms of a project. You know? A fucking crackhead ran this way. Tss, tss, tss, tss, tss. And then another one jumped out a tree and shit. Tss, tss, tss, tss, tsk. And I said, I'll be right back. And left me. Took the keys with me, just left me. At 3 o'clock in the morning, in front of a project, in a fucking limousine. This was not good. I was like, man, I gotta look around, see if I can see some landmarks, and figure out where I'm at. Might have to escape on foot. Now this is when I knew I was in a bad neighborhood. You only see this in the worst neighborhoods. Remember, it's three o'clock in the morning. It's three o'clock in the morning. I look out the window. It was a fucking baby standing on a corner. Look at this. It was a fucking baby standing on a corner. And the baby, the baby didn't even look scared. He was just standing there. I mean it made me sad, it made me sad really. You know what I mean? Because I wanted to help the baby. I wanted to help the baby. I wanted to help the baby. I wanted to help the baby. I wanted to help the baby. I wanted to help the baby. I wanted to help the baby., it made me sad really. You know, because I wanted to help the baby. I was like, I don't trust you either, I'm sorry. Click, click. The old baby on the corner trick, eh? Not gonna fall for that shit. Where's this limousine driver? You know, I start feeling bad. As time goes by, I start feeling worse. Like, man, what is wrong with me? What the hell is wrong? I am scared of a baby. And this baby could be in trouble. He might need my help. I gotta do something. But I wasn't gonna get out the car. I'm serious, man. I just cracked the window a little bit. There's an old limousine, I can roll it down. Hey, baby! Baby, go home, man, it's 3 o'clock in the morning, what the fuck are you doing up?
