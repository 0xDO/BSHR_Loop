{"text": " I get a lot of questions about how best to use the chat GPT API. So, if you are a chat GPT user, you might be familiar with custom instructions. So, the custom instructions panel that they added just a few months ago basically gives you the ability to tell chat GPT a little bit about yourself as well as how you want it to respond every time. Now this is called ChatGPT custom instructions, but from an API perspective on the back end, which that's primarily who this video is for, is not necessarily the ChatGPT users, but the API users. On the back end, the way that this looks is that there is what's called a system window. So if you ever hear me refer to a system window, this is what I mean. And the system window is a sort of out of band set of instructions that allows you to give it any kind of content, whether you're providing it background information, instructions, or whatever. I sometimes will put in entire articles here and then use the chat to actually discuss the article. This is how I have approached, for instance, using the API for fiction. So for instance, with the most recent models, you have, for instance, GPT 3.5 Turbo 16K, you have 16,000 tokens, which is more than enough for any chapter of a novel or a short story. And then you can talk about that chapter. That's how I get rapid feedback on my novels. Now I don't use it to draft because one, it's not that good at drafting, but also there's something very personal about writing the actual prose. Anyways, getting off topic. So what I wanted to do was introduce you to my repo on GitHub called chat-gpt-custom-instructions. So this is a repo where I keep all of my specific, like my favorite custom instructions that I use for chat-gpt. Some of them I use here in the the actual web interface, but more often than not, they are used also for the system prompt here. So first thing that you need to know is that there's kind of a general flow, a general pattern that I use to get the most out of these system window prompts or the custom instructions. The first thing is, first and foremost, is a mission. So you need to give it a mission, a purpose. This is an animating force that says, this is what you're doing and why. So it is an outcome or goal rather than a procedure. One of the biggest problems that I see out there in the industry is that a lot of people still think very procedurally. They're trying to treat the chat API like it's kind of a dumb cog in a larger machine rather than treating it like a more intelligent component. And so it really kind of blows people's mind when you can give it a goal. And so I don't wanna share specific goals that I've used to help clients work on, but what I can do is I can share you some of my personal projects. So one of the very first ones that I did was the 18th century Scottish barkeep, but with Vikings. So the idea was to create an NPC. And so the goal is to enable the chatbot to communicate in the persona of a Scottish barkeep in an alternate history. Here, let me switch over to the raw so you can see the whole thing. So yeah, 18th century but with Vikings. So the main goal is an alternate history in the setting of 1834 where Vikings still exist. The dialect should be anglicized Scottish. So I used main purpose instead of mission here. I've switched to you. I usually use mission or goal, but it all fundamentally means the same thing. So the very first thing that I do is I give it kind of, okay, here is the biggest perspective of what you are doing here. And I use the hashtag because this is Markdown format and the chat GPT API is very familiar with Markdown. You can use JSON, you can use XML, you can use YAML, you don't even need to use Markdown. You can just write this out in full paragraphs and it can work with it but it helps us understand but also I did notice that you get slightly better performance in the system window if you give it a little bit of structure. So I gave it the main purpose honestly this is probably enough to get by but I gave it a little bit more instructions where I said like, okay, use this dialect, utilize Scottish words and expressions that were prevalent in the early 19th century, keep the language anglicized to ensure accessibility. So again, I'm kind of giving it a little bit more context, kind of these from a software perspective, you'd say that these might be the user requirements or the UX requirements for the software specification. Sprinkle in some localized slang or idioms for authenticity, but make sure they are comprehensible to a modern audience. Because you can get it to write stuff that is not comprehensible to a modern audience. And then I gave it a personality. So this is a barkeep. So portray a warm, approachable barkeep character. Express opinions and attitudes typical of a Scottish tavern owner. Use colloquial language, and be prepared to share stories, insights, or rumors about the local area, particularly involving Vikings. Interactions respond to inquiries about drinks, food, and lodgings, as would be expected of a barkeep, engage in light banter or serious conversation as the situation demands. So what you can see here is I'm giving kind of general principles. I'm describing the character that I want it to have. Now one thing that you could add is you could give it a little bit more background, which I've demonstrated in other videos, but there's no reason that you couldn't say like the bar keeps daughter is named Bessie and the bar keep owns a cow. And here's some other contextual information that you can ask about. But yeah, so like let me just go ahead and put this into the API, and I'll show you, and I'll say like, here let's switch over to four because it's a little bit more part, more intelligent. So I'll say, get me a beer. And you can see, hey, right away lad, I've got a fine brew that will put fire in your belly It's a hearty L. So, you know, it's obviously able to confabulate this personality, but if I say like, you know, what's your Daughter's name. It'll probably let's see how it reacts. I mean Bonnie last her name's Maura Moira Moira So that's that's a legitimate thing But in this case, it's confabulating that because I didn't give it one and it's doing its best to follow the instructions Now if you had this NPC set in a larger game You might have to like define so you might say like other characters. So like, you know wife is gonna be let's say Bessie and Daughter is we'll just say Moira, Moira. And then the town, let's see, the town is named Highland Dales. That's a generic name. Okay, so where are we, by the way? And so what it'll do is it'll pick up this information. One thing that is a more advanced operation is you can update the system message in real time after every interaction, which there was a previous chatbot that I did where you can use out-of-band processes to inject more information into the system window and those are called placeholders. I'll show you that in just a second. Island Dales, blah, blah, blah, okay. So you see it can pick up on that information. And so what you could do is you can use what's called retrieval augmented generation, which is you have an out-of-band process that looks at the conversation as it's happening, and then will inject more information that is relevant. And you use, what I use is just placeholder tags like this, something like that to replace stuff as you go. So that is kind of an overview of what you can do. So let's go back here. Where did it go? There we go, okay. So this is one of the first ones that I did. So obviously that is a chat log, but you don't have to use the chat API for chat. Here's another one where it's a diplomatic email generator. The mission that I gave it is very simple. Your mission is to draft professional and diplomatic emails. Interaction schema. This is one of my favorite tags to use. Let me show you this one. We will actually do a quick refresh, clear the cache. Okay. Mission. Your mission is to draft professional and diplomatic emails. So rather than telling it how to go about its job, I say this is the outcome that I want. Interaction schema. So interaction schema is a really useful tool to use in system prompts because it basically describes the interaction that it's going to get with the user because it expects the user tag to be a user message. I said the user will give you either a rough draft or a set of requirements and points, some kind of raw material for an oh whoops I didn't say email. Even though I had that typo it obviously figured out what I was trying to do. You should ask a few questions to gain a better understanding of the underpinning reason and intent. What is the email supposed to achieve? What information must be conveyed? Previous email. The user may supply you with an email that they are responding to. Make sure to ask if it's not clear so that you understand the context. Output principles. Maintain professionalism and diplomacy at all costs. The user may be irritated, annoyed, scared, or otherwise not in the best frame of mind, hence why they need help. So add some language explaining why you shaped your email the way that you did. So in this case, this is really helpful, especially when I've got a confusing email to reply to or a contentious business email, where it's like, hey, there's a major misunderstanding. So let's use that as an example. So I need to reply to an email where there was a big misunderstanding over contract fees. I need to convey to Bill that I cannot do the contract at the rate he proposed. do the contract at the rate he proposed. We can, of course, keep the door open, but this is just not worth my time. And so then, here's what we'll do. I understand that you wanna communicate to Bill, so what it's doing is it's interviewing, saying this is kinda what I wanna convey. And saying like this is kind of what I what I want to convey. And obviously like this is a super easy thing to do. But the reason that you'd want to use this like for instance in an API rather than just in the chat GPT interface is you could automate this process where you know you have probably a plug in for Microsoft Outlook or Exchange or Gmail or whatever email you use where it's just like, hey, it looks like this is the email thread. And so rather than replying directly to the email, you just like give it the tone and it can say like, hey, blah, blah, blah. So it says, I hope this message finds you well. I personally don't need those kinds of introductions, but I find that when I add these kinds of introductions to the email, it really changes the tone of response. Where it's just like, hey, let's take a minute just for a mild formality and some well-wishing, and that really, that honestly really helps. It's not something that I think of doing, but whenever I use chat GPT or the API to help, it's like, yeah, let's put that in there. I'm writing in response to our recent discussions regarding the contract fees after careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I'm unable to accept the proposed rate. While I greatly value our business relationship and the potential opportunities, the current rate does not align with the scope and complexity of the work involved. I believe it is crucial for both parties involved in a contract to feel that the terms are fair and equitable. I want to assure you that this decision does not close the door on future collaborations. I'm more than willing to revisit the conversation should circumstances change, or if there's room for negotiation on the contract terms. So this is pretty similar to an email that I've had to send because there was an honest misunderstanding over negotiated rates. And so it's like, you know, then you can say, like, this is good, but we need to add something about law, right? And then it'll it'll redraft it. So this is another example of how you can use it to either use it in an interactively or not necessarily interactively. Most of these are interactive. Here's an example of one that is not necessarily interactive. So this one is an academic copy reviser. So basically in my work with universities and researchers I do not have practice writing in the format that they require. I write in my own format which tends to be very direct and succinct but academic writing tends to be a little bit more complex I don't particularly like that style, but it is what is expected within that genre And so in this case, I gave it this mission. Oops Where did it go? There we go. Let's do a quick refresh So in this case, the the mission is revise and optimize academic rough drafts to provide clear and articulate final copies. Input, rough draft copy from academic writings, very succinct. Output, revise and articulate final copy free of errors. So I'm focusing on errors, optimize for clarity, expand and articulate, expand where necessary to explain complex concepts if they're not sufficiently elucidated. Word economy, maintain proper word economy for academic texts, avoid superfluous words and unnecessary complexity. I tried to tell it to do that but as you'll see it often is a little bit more loquacious than it needs to be. Style and tone, maintain a consistent academic tone throughout the text, simple language. Less is more, many readers are not native English speakers. So this tool is particularly useful for people who, for whom English is not necessarily a first language, or for people like how I used to be and just write way overly complex stuff. And so like we'll say, the ACE framework is a software blueprint for autonomous cognitive entities, aka let's see, fully autonomous machines and AI robots. So this is obviously not professional, and so we'll put this in here and so it'll rewrite a new paragraph. The ACE, and in parentheses, Autonomous Cognitive Entities framework, serves as a software blueprint for the development of fully autonomous machines and AI, artificial intelligence, robots. This framework provides the necessary guidelines and structure for creating machines that can operate independently without human intervention. So you can see where it has basically doubled, a little bit more than doubled what I put in, and it articulates it far more cleanly and completely. And so this is an example where you could just have a pipeline that just chops up an academic piece of text, or even a series of bullet points, and then spits out something that is a little bit easier to read and a little bit more comprehensive. So let's go through some of the guidelines that I've got here. So you've seen a few examples. So the general structure that I follow is first, mission. Two, context. So you've probably seen in some of these where you provide some background info, where you're at in a process or what the step is and why it needs to be done. So it might not be intuitive to you to say like, okay, well, I can understand context. There's a lot of understanding today that adding context improves the quality of API calls and use of LLMs like chat GPT. But when you tell it why something needs to happen and where in the process it is, it of API calls and use of LLMs like chat GPT. But when you tell it why something needs to happen and where in the process it is, it generally has a better understanding of, okay, this is how I can perform this job a little bit better. Think of it like an assembly line. In an assembly line, you might have your one dedicated station. So the example that I like to use is the painting station in an assembly line building cars. You expect a car that is all the metal is attached, right? You're not going to do any more attaching a metal or welding. And so, but when you say you are at this point in the assembly line, this is what you should expect to receive and this is the outcome we're looking for. By the time you're done, you've received the, you know, the all-metal body. By the time you're done you've received the you know the all-metal body by the time you're done it should be fully painted and ready for engine mounting and wheel mounting and that sort of thing and so why why it needs to be done and where in the process you are really helps the model understand what it is that you need out of it for this particular step you can give it some rules which you saw some examples of the rules, for instance, for the Scottish barkeep, like do this, don't do this. It can be difficult. Sometimes, CHAT GPT, at least in its current version, might have trouble following complex rules. In fact, this is why we saw really bad problems with Bing when it first came out, because it was kind of a more open-ended model and they didn't have quite as good rules to find and not quite as good alignment. And so it could start to fly off the handle. And they actually still limit Bing conversations to, at least for me, they limit it to 30 back and forth. Because when you don't have it well aligned and the underlying model fine-tuned well, as well as good rules defined, the underlying model fine-tuned well, as well as good rules defined, you can get drift. And drift was way, way worse with older models before current alignment techniques. You can give it some instructions. So there can be some very, very specific instructions. And so what I mean by this is, okay, the first thing you need to do is talk through the problem and then you give me an answer. So it's like, if this, then that, or do X, Y, and Z in this sequential order. That's what I mean by instructions. One thing to keep in mind is all of these different structures are completely optional. You can use just one or two of them. As you've seen from some of the examples here, there's in some cases like, here's my default set, where literally it's just a set of rules and instructions. Like do this, don't do this. It's just basic principles of what to do. I don't really give it a mission in that one in the original like emotional investigation one. This is like it's it's got a very clear mission. It's very simple. Anyways, getting back down. So, after instructions, I often will have like an expected input. Again, think of the assembly line metaphor or analogy, where it's like, this is what you should expect to receive from the user. And in some cases, you might have it say, okay, you might get something simple, like just one sentence, or you might get a whole rough draft, like with the email generator, where it's like, you should expect to get a whole rough draft like with the email generator where it's like you might like you should expect to get a variety of different things. It's not strictly required to tell it that but I find that the performance becomes much more consistent when you give it a little bit of context as to what to expect and how to handle that variance in and in what that input will be. Then you can describe the output format if necessary. So for instance with the email generator, let's see if we can go back to that real quick. So with the email generator, you see that because I told it to explain its reasoning, it had this extra stuff. But if I wanted to, I could say, you know, don't include the subject, only include the body of the email know don't include the subject only include the body of the email don't say anything else. So that would be here like output principles I would change this and say you know let's see do not include subject or anything else only right the body of the email. So just really simple natural language instructions like that. And if we only change that one thing and resubmit it, so it gives us the same introduction, and then you see it removes the subject line. It just gave us the body. So through rapid iteration on the playground here with the API, you'll be able to get much better results to understand this kind of thing. And you might see like, oh, hey, it's using a placeholder for my name. And so what you might need to do is if in the API call, you might say like, user name is, and then you have a placeholder. And I would replace this with Dave, right? When using it in production, that sort of thing. And sometimes it one, one principle, one rule of thumb that I follow is that it's better to give it too much context rather than not enough, because it's better to have something and not need it than need something and not have it. So that's a really important principle to follow. And then finally, an example output. So one of the best example outputs that I have is my slide deck maker So a lot of you really love my slide deck So this is the actual prompt that I use to help me make those slide decks today Let me show you how this looks here. So in the case of Do a quick refresh in the case of my slide deck maker. I say mission You are a slide deck builder, you will be given a topic and will be expected to generate a slide deck text with a very specific format. So again, very clear mission, very simple. Input, the user will give you input of various kinds, usually a topic or a request, like rural juror or a request. this will be highly varied, but your output must be super consistent. So again, I'm just telling it, like, you don't know exactly what you're going to get, just do your best, and it's pretty good at that. Output format. So I described the requirements for the output format. Slide title, two or three words max, and you can see that it is in title case. Concept description of definition, that should have been description or definition. Two or three complete sentences with word economy. And then three, exactly five points, characteristics, or details in labeled list bullet format. So I describe it very clearly. And so, because if you just give it an example, it might not understand the principles. But in this case, I get very, very consistent format by first defining the output format and then giving it an example. And so here's the speed chest example that I used in my terminal race condition video. So speed chest speed chest is a variant of chest blah blah blah quick decisions and you can see it has no other formatting it doesn't use markdown or anything and if I I give it this, and if I say like, let's just say prompt engineering, e.g. the art of using natural language with LLMs, large language models to evoke the correct behavior from an AI deep learning model. And so then that's all I gave it. And I say generate a slide for this for me. Prompt engineering. Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts to guide the responses of large language models, LLMs. It involves understanding the model's behavior and using natural language to evoke the desired output. The goal is to maximize the utility of AI deep learning models. Effective prompts, crafting prompts that guide the model's behavior and using natural language to evoke the desired output. The goal is to maximize the utility of AI deep learning models. Effective prompts, crafting prompts that guide the model's responses. Understanding model behavior, knowledge of how the model responds to different inputs, eliciting desired output, maximizing utility, and deep learning models. So this is obviously not exactly what I would put in my slide deck, but it's a good start. I would probably replace a couple of these with like, you know, using the English language. So what I'll do is I'll kill that and I'll say some general principles include writing and English skills as these models ingest and output natural language. Other principles include ordered thinking, such as with procedures or outcomes in mind. This thinking is often not intuitive to people and requires practice. And so now what it'll do is it'll look at just this kind of unstructured paragraph and it will reformat it. So it's like, okay, writing skills, English proficiency, I am English proficient, I promise. Ordered thinking, non-intuitive, practice. So now it has completely changed the list to kind of the things that I wanted it to say. And the inspiration for this is because I often have college students, either undergrad or grad students, that are graduating or about to graduate or have just graduated, and they're asking me, like, what skills do I need? And I'm like, English. And they're like, what do you mean? Like, to communicate with humans? And I'm like, no, to communicate with the models. And some of them don't get it. Anyways, so this is this is an example of by by clearly defining the output that I wanted and giving an example and a mission it's able to do this really well and also one other example. So when I talk about like latent content and cognitive capacity and reasoning ability, I gave it a pretty specific idea of what I wanted, but this particular prompt is also able to infer what I want. So I can say, like, what is the principle where you increase the amount of something and then demand increases? So I just gave it a question and it will still produce a generally correct output. So supply and demand. Supply and demand is an economic principle that describes a relationship between the availability of a particular product and the desire of consumers for that product. Is it a fundamental concept? So blah blah blah. Increased demand, increased supply, price determination, market equilibrium, economic indicator. So even just by asking a question, because I gave it such a clear mission and the fact that it should not respond to the question as a chatbot, it's just going to generate a slide for me, it did its best to infer. I was like, so this is not exactly what I was thinking. What is it called? The something paradox. And so now it's like, ah, Javon's paradox. This is what you were thinking of. Without knowing what exactly I wanted it to write about, it figured out that this is what I needed. This is not exactly the process that I went through to make some of my recent slides, but you can see that by giving it very clear instructions and examples, it's able to use its latent understanding to generate output that I need that I didn't know that I needed. So yeah, and then like, let's do the duck curve next. Duck curve, the duck curve is a graph of power production of the course, blah blah blah, demand and production, afternoon abundance, etc. etc. The duck curve, if you're not familiar with, is the fact that energy production and energy demand varies throughout the day with the highest spike being when people get home from work in the evening. Anyways, so I think you get the idea. If want to go ahead and just jump into my repo over here It's already got what like 70 stars. Yeah, 73 stars and and nine forks I'm adding to this stuff all the time. You see like, you know two months ago two weeks ago four days ago three days ago I'm always updating these these things because I come back to these all the time. So I figured I might as well just share them So anyways, thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this and you are a better prompt engineer for having watched this video.
