{"text": " Morning, everybody. David Shapiro here with a video. So this is the first video of my new channel. I split it off from AI because, well, some people are just there for AI, but there's a lot more to talk about. And so my second biggest project of all time is my study of nihilism and working on post-niihilism. So the purpose of today's video is to introduce what I call the nihilistic crisis and the four abandonments. So in order to get started we need to talk about nihilism. What is nihilism? Nihilism is a philosophy that started in the 19th century in Russia. It basically means, or says, that nothing means anything. There is no intrinsic value or meaning to anything in life. The universe is intrinsically apathetic, meaningless, etc. etc. Friedrich Nietzsche famously said, God is dead, God remains dead, and we have killed him. This is a very poetic way of just kind of exemplifying the abandonment we feel. And we'll get into that. So there's a few reactions to the rise of nihilism. Or rather, the rise of nihilism, or rather the rise of nihilism as a reaction to several things, mostly which happened in the late 19th and 20th century. War, famine, the rise of secularism, events like the holocaust all created massive shocks to the zeitgeist which really embedded nihilism. So nihilism existed before the horrors of World War I, World War II, the Cold War, the People's Revolution, Stalinism, but what happened was people saw these things happening across the world and said, what does it all mean? What kind of world do we live in that this is allowed to happen? And so the reaction was a sense of nihilism. Maybe it doesn't mean anything. Okay, so where is nihilism today? We talked about where it started, how it got started, but where is it? So nihilism is mostly in the West, but it has become a global phenomenon. It is marked by widespread cynicism, despair, hopelessness, anger, rejection, and isolation. It is, and as I just described, it is deeply embedded in the zeitgeist. Now, and I forgot to mention this, but now it is also being further compounded by the climate crisis. We see that we're doomed, right? Doom is a huge component of popular media today. And we say, okay, what's the point? We're all going to go extinct anyways. Who cares? We also see nihilism reflected in other very popular TV shows, such as The Witcher, where hope is actively punished. So for instance, in The Witcher, any time there's a character who says, we're going to make positive change, they almost always get killed in the next scene. Ditto for Game of Thrones. In both of those shows, which were wildly popular, there is a nihilistic undertone, sometimes explicitly stated on the screen, where there is no point in struggling, there is no point in fighting, the world is doomed, it's awful, it's never going to get any better, blah blah blah blah blah, do you hear the despair, do you hear the nihilism in it? And the reason that these shows resonate with us is because it resonates with the nihilism that we have that has been pervasive since before we were all born, honestly. We grew up with nihilism and therefore it's kind of like asking the fish if the water is wet. We don't know anything else. It has been here since before we were born and that's why we can't identify it by virtue of contrast. Nihilism is also reflected in our current economic policy and politics. We have stagnant wages. There's this mentality of eat the rich, neglect the poor. There's class warfare and that sort of thing. OK, so this is really broad. I'm talking about a global phenomenon that is approaching two centuries old. So that's too big to eat in one go. It's just too much. So I classify nihilism into four broad categories that I call the four abandonments. So the four abandonments are 1. Childhood abandonment, 2. Social abandonment, 3. Cosmic Abandonment 4. Self Abandonment We're about to go over all of these in greater detail. Also remember this is just an introductory video. I'll have follow-up videos where I unpack each one of these in much greater detail. So, Abandonment number 1, Childhood Abandonment. This is most notably seen as in the form of excessive screen time, but excessive screen time on its own doesn't convey the full picture. Because what has to happen, what else has to be true for excessive screen time to be a thing? Excessive screen time happens because there are no adults around for children. Either they are too busy, too tired, they're at work, or whatever, and also it means that we live in nuclear homes where there aren't aunts and uncles and grandparents around. We don't have the village. We have lost the human village and we have moved to nuclear homes which are not supportive enough to children or parents. And this has a huge number of knock-on effects. Screen time is not the only aspect of childhood abandonment, it is just the most familiar one. We've all seen the kid at the store screaming for the iPad or the phone, and it's really, really depressing because children will prefer the safety and security of the screen rather than human interaction because the screens are more stable, reliable, and available. And so some of the knock-on effects that we have from childhood abandonment is that we don't have a transfer of generational knowledge. Grandparents are kind of often in their own world. Sometimes they're shuffled off to care homes, or they're across state lines, and you only get to see them a few times a year. And so then, grandparents are like, I'm just gonna spoil my kids, or my grandkids. And they're not really an integral component of the family in terms of providing stability and support and knowledge. We see this disconnect with the rise of intergenerational distrust and resentment. It reached a fever pitch a few years ago with the OK Boomer trend, where people usually my age, millennials, just got so fed up with the judgment and criticism that we were getting from the boomers, the very same generation that abandoned us, and were basically criticizing us as a form of projection for their own failures. And so we said, okay, boomer, whatever. Fortunately that has quieted down. Not sure all the reasons why, but it has. And I do want to hang a lampshade on this. Some of this is just life. The trend of kids these days has literally been true for all of recorded history. There are tablets from ancient Greece and Rome and graffiti where basically people are bellyaching about, ah, kids these days don't respect their elders. This is just a fact of life. Teens and young people rebel against the status quo. This is part and parcel of being a human, and then once we get older, we feel a little bit more entitled and judgmental. So some of this is just human nature, but it is also exaggerated right now. So excessive screen time is just a symptom of a much more pervasive problem, which is the death of more traditional family structures and village life, and it is also representative of the growth of childhood emotional neglect. This is the clinical term for what it is, and I'll probably have a much longer video on CEN, childhood emotional neglect, in the future, but you can, if you're impatient, you can look it up now. But the long story short is that CEN has profound impacts, durable impacts, on anxiety, worldview, success, and loneliness throughout life. It is, emotional neglect is a very quiet kind of childhood trauma that is very difficult to identify and even harder to recover from. And it is part of what we'll talk about as the vicious cycle. Nihilism starts in childhood and is sustained throughout life in a vicious cycle, or self-fulfilling prophecy is another way of saying it. So to add a little bit of data to this, loneliness is an epidemic and it skews young. So this is what I mean when I say that nihilism is intergenerational and it's also following a vicious cycle. The nihilism that our boomer parents and the greatest generation and the silent generation were exposed to has compounded throughout the subsequent generations. The people that fought through World War I and World War II and Vietnam and lived under the Red Scare they all had this sense of nihilism, this sense of heck with it, you know, we might get nuked tomorrow or whatever you know, They saw horrors. And so then with all these contributing factors, when combined also with technology, the rise of social media, the rise of technology jobs, and so on and so forth, we all end up with this compounding sense of purposelessness and whatever, right? And so we see this reflected in the actual data where Gen Z is the loneliest generation we have ever created, even though they're digital natives. They're more connected than any generation in history, yet they are the loneliness. So this paradox, people have been puzzling over this paradox, the underlying cause, I'm not saying the method, the mechanistic way that it is implemented is nihilism, but nihilism is the underpinning philosophical current, cultural current, that is driving a lot of this. And so again, it's important to remember that nihilism is an intergenerational phenomenon. What's going to happen when Gen Z, the loneliest generation of all time, grows up and starts voting and grows up and has children of their own? They might react by doubling down and just saying, oh, it's a lonely world, whatever, we don't care. Or they might react differently. They might react the opposite and say let's focus on having connection. That is why I am making these videos because the problem is intergenerational and the solution must also be intergenerational. Abandonment number two is social abandonment. Homelessness and hunger are a choice, and I don't mean a choice for the individual. It is a choice of society. We have a surplus of calories and foods, of calories and homes to go around, yet we still have homelessness and hunger. The reason is because we have decided, we have actively decided not to give things away. We have decided not to redistribute. And the reason that we have that, there's a lot of religious and cultural reasons behind that. There's a lot of baggage, but the net effect is that you're not, quote, a real person unless you earn your keep. In today's society, particularly in America, less so in Europe, but particularly in America, you are not a real person until you prove that you are with income. I just watched a French movie yesterday, and they kind of just casually mentioned like, Oh, freedom is based on how much money you have, and they all just kind of laughed and agreed like, Oh, yeah, of course, you get it. But that is literally one of the central tenets of neoliberalism, which is that you are as free as your dollars make you. And that's what I mean when I say you have to earn your personhood. neoliberalism, which is that you are as free as your dollars make you. And that's what I mean when I say you have to earn your personhood. If you don't have any money, you are not free in this society. If you have money, you are more free in this society. But it's not just freedom, it is you're not a real person. And so this leads to all kinds of problems like competitive culture, hustle culture, and stuff that we'll talk a little bit more later in the video. But really, another way of calling it is just class warfare. We see it with stagnant wages, we see it with rugged individualism, and then of course there were all the memes at the beginning of the pandemic that said, what about the economy? What about the economy? So why does GDP more than human life? And the reason is social abandonment driven by nihilism. Deaths from despair are rising. So productivity is rising. I don't have a chart for that, but productivity is rising and it has risen dramatically in the last couple decades. But so are deaths from despair, which deaths from despair are deaths from alcoholism and other preventable causes that I won't go into explicitly, but I do have a link here. Oops, come back. There we go, sorry about that. So what gives in? If we're more productive than ever, but wages are stagnating and we're lonelier and sicker than ever, why? Why are we not reaping the benefits of this increased productivity? And the reason is because we have abandoned each other in this form of social abandonment. And that abandonment is codified in law, but it's also codified in just cultural mores and in our zeitgeist. And so we keep working harder and things keep getting worse and that really sucks and that is why we see a sharp rise in deaths from despair. Abandonment number three is what I call cosmic abandonment. Now cosmic abandonment is partially, I'm not gonna say driven by, but is reflected by the rise of secularism, empiricism, objectivism, materialism, science, and so on. We keep examining things and there's no answers. There's no empirical evidence of gods or deities or religion beyond the fact that we exist. But that that leaves a lot open up for debate. And so spirituality as a whole has declined, and I've got a chart showing that in a moment. We feel abandoned by all deities, which was very directly bluntly addressed in the movie Thor Love and Thunder, which we'll address again near the end of this video. But it's also been addressed in video games like Dragon Age, where the lore in Dragon Age says the Maker has abandoned us. Like, the game literally explicitly says, we have been abandoned by the Maker, and there may be no hope in ever getting back into the maker's good graces. So we find ourselves in a lonely, empty, cold, and indifferent universe. And that is really scary. We feel abandoned at every level. We feel abandoned in our childhood, we feel abandoned by each other, and we feel abandoned by the universe as a whole. by the universe as a whole. With no evidence of a higher power or some higher authority, then what does anything mean? Where do we derive meaning and how do we find purpose? So again, I like backing up some of what I'm saying with data. This chart shows the percent of population that is religiously unaffiliated. So in the last couple decades alone, since the 1970s, we've gone from 5% to 25% of the population is religiously unaffiliated. That is a quintupling of the religiously unaffiliated. We went from 1 20th of the population to 1 quarter of the population is religiously unaffiliated. Now I did say that there's an overall decline in spirituality, but there's also a bit of a renaissance in spirituality going on. Witches and neo-paganism and a few other things are on the rise, but they're still a very, very small minority. And so, I don't really have an answer for this. I need to point out that correlation does not equal causation. I'm not putting the cart before the horse in saying that the rise in irreligiosity is being caused by or a cause of nihilism. I'm just saying it is a reflection that a lot of these things are happening at the same time. Religious unaffiliation is going up at the same time as deaths from despair, at the same time as anxiety and loneliness. I don't think it's an accident that all of these things are rising at the same time, which is why I call it the nihilistic crisis. The nihilistic crisis is the through line that binds all of these trends together. And finally, what happens when all of these crises come together, childhood abandonment, social abandonment, and finally cosmic abandonment, once the feeling of futility and apathy takes over, once it becomes too much to bear, we give up on ourselves. We change the way that we orient to ourselves. We say, you know what, I actually don't care anymore. I don't care, I'm just gonna do what feels good or even punish myself. There are lots of people that have internalized this nihilism so deeply that they actually kind of hurt themselves, and I mentioned this briefly earlier, with hustle culture and workaholism and hyper-partisan politics and crab mentality. And all of this, rugged individualism, all of this is a reaction to the abandonment that we all feel. Where hustle culture says, ah, well, we all know that if we work hard enough and make enough money, then we're going to be real people. So what do you do? You work as hard as you can to make more money because only people with enough money, those are real people. And then another reaction to that is hyper-partisan politics where it's I feel abandoned, I'm angry, I don't want to be erased, I don't want to be replaced. And so you see this on both sides, far left and far right, where there is so much anger on both sides and it all comes down to abandonment and neglect and a sense of futility, which makes, which then drives into apathy. But one possible reaction rather than apathy is anger and violence. Anger is a very important emotion. Anger is one of the primary purposes of anger is to give us energy to right an injustice. That is one of the primary causes of anger and so we either end up angry or apathetic. But if we collapse into self-abandonment we favor apathy. So depression, anxiety, and isolation are all on the rise particularly among young people. So remember this is an intergenerational phenomenon and it is part of a vicious cycle. It gets worse over time until we do something about it. You can't just ignore this problem. It's not going to go away on its own. It's only going to get worse. So as apathy, anger, and everything compounds, we also see rises in various kinds of violence, which I won't go into details. But suffice to say, there is plenty of news out there about violence, specifically America. Okay, so I've painted a very bleak picture. What do we do about it? We need an answer, but there's a lot to unpack here. So one thing we can do, we can address the abandonments one by one. For childhood abandonment, we can prioritize child care, prioritize family structures. We could revitalize multi-generational homes. There's also plenty of people banding together and forming co-living situations. There are quite a few articles out there of usually single parents banding together under one roof, which I think is phenomenal. So they're basically creating a modern kind of village. We also need to address the underlying problem of nihilism though. So while we can address the abandonments directly with empirical objective steps such as changing how we live, how we vote, how we work, we can also address the philosophical, psychological, and spiritual aspects of nihilism. So how do we do that? How do we address the philosophical aspect of this problem? We need to move beyond nihilism. So I've been accused of being an anti-nihilist, somewhat angrily. I'm not an anti-nihilist. I acknowledge the validity of Nihilism. I acknowledge that, yes, from a certain perspective, the world seems completely and utterly pointless. I have accepted that. I lived it. And then I realized it's not good enough. It's not satisfying. It also seems childish. And so what I realized is that we need to move past nihilism. We need to go through it. This would not be the first time that we have gone through any particular philosophical or intellectual disposition. We had modernism and we moved through that to postmodernism. We have nihilism and now it is time to break that vicious cycle of nihilism and move into post nihilism. So post nihilism is more what we need. It has not been fully defined yet. It can take decades to define these movements. And often, these intellectual and philosophical movements can only be accurately described after the fact, post facto. So the first thing we need to do is just address the vicious cycle. This is the elephant in the room. Nihilism is intergenerational. I have said that time and again in this video. And intergenerational support is part of breaking the cycle, which is why one of the potential solutions is trying to figure out how to have intergenerational homes or communities support networks. Childhood abandonment, it all starts in childhood with childhood abandonment. Childhood abandonment results in nihilistic and individualistic despairing worldview which sets us up to accept and expect abandonment in the future. So children raised with emotional neglect can't really think of anything else even as adults and even once you become aware of it it's very difficult to break this cycle. So it becomes a self-perpetuating loop or a vicious cycle. On and on nihilism has passed from one generation to the next. So we need post-nihilism. The best that I've got so far is that post-nihilism says yes, there is some validity to nihilism, but after you really closely examine the core assertion that life is meaningless, that nothing is intrinsically meaningful, that doesn't seem true or satisfying to me. And so what I experimented with was, what if we say the opposite? What if we say that all life is actually intrinsically valuable? We say that because life is rare, and that makes us special. So if we change our philosophical disposition towards ourselves and all life, we say all life is intrinsically valuable, that changes how we orient towards ourselves and then to each other and we can start to break the cycle. We make different choices, we place different values on things, and in fact we can create an entirely new value structure or moral system. Post-nihilism needs to be explored and defined. As I mentioned, it takes decades to fully explore and define these movements, and often we can only clearly see them when they're in the rearview mirror and society is ready to move on. But the way that we do that is we get together, we talk about it, we debate it, we write about it, which is exactly why I'm making this video. That is the entire purpose of making this video is to help start the conversation. We can also make art about it. We can make art in the form of movies, music, books, tv, images, pretty much any kinds of art. We can explore nihilism versus post-nihilism because stories are powerful. Stories are actually the primary way that we teach each other philosophy in society. This was originally done through myths and legends, then the Greek tragedies, those had moral lessons. Many moral lessons were codified in religious texts such as the Bible, and now we use film and TV as our primary vehicles of storytelling. And the stories that we tell each other are All the reason that those stories resonate is because it resonates with something that feels true Long story short post nihilism will be a community effort. All I can do is describe what I see. I've put a name on it I have tried to articulate it as best as I can, but I'm just one person and so it has to be a community-based effort, just like post-modernism before and existentialism. Both of these started in France, in Paris I believe, with young people getting together, talking about it, writing about it, debating, and then eventually it gets codified in you know in seminal works on philosophy by like Albert Camus and others and Jean-Paul Sartre. So basically I'm just trying to start the conversation. So let's talk about some examples of post-nihilism. So I gave you plenty of data points about Nihilism, but let's talk about post-Nihilism in art, specifically in film. Thor Love and Thunder is one of the best works of post-Nihilism art that I have seen. In this movie, the gods are all very explicitly absent. They are cruel and they are mocking. This is a reflection of cosmic abandonment. As I said, I didn't come up with this I just put a name on it. So the problem in Thor love and thunder is cosmic abandonment We have a character named gore who whose daughter dies in his arms because his gods abandoned him He finds his gods and then he is so angry that he wants to go kill all gods. This is a direct, a completely direct reflection of Nietzsche. God is dead. God remains dead. We have killed him. So this is basically nihilism made manifest. Gore is so angry that this mythical sword appears that gives him the power to kill all gods, and he goes on a rampage to destroy gods. Meanwhile, Thor goes, himself a god, goes to try and elicit the help of other gods. Zeus mocks him, and so what does Thor do? Thor kills Zeus. This is a deeply symbolic attack on saying, okay, the gods are useless, the gods are not present, we don't need them, so let's kill them. This is what Nietzsche was trying to say more than a hundred years ago. The story progresses, the children are abducted, which is a symbol of childhood abandonment, and so then Thor and and Natalie Portman I can't remember his name at the moment they go on a quest to save the children of Asgard and to stop the God-killer a gore succeeds in getting to the center of the universe and he's granted one wish and gore sees thor cradling natalie portman as she's dying of cancer and he says you know what you've won do what you will but remember that you can wish for anything and so gore at the very end despite having won despite having the power to kill all the gods Therefore, at the very end, despite having won, despite having the power to kill all the gods, he chooses love instead. He chooses to bring back his daughter. And the message of this movie, which is why I loved it so much, is that we don't need the gods. Cosmic abandonment doesn't matter. What we really need is each other and we need love. Another good post-nihilistic work is Everything, Everywhere, All at Once. This movie explores the absurdity of existence. It posits that we live in a multiverse where anything is possible. Literally any permutation of life is possible, including many universes where there is no life. So it says, okay, in this grand cosmic perspective, this hypercosmic perspective where anything that you can do has been done by a copy of you and has been done better. And they actually make fun of Evelyn in this movie because they say, oh you're actually in the worst version of Evelyn's life. And it's like, because that's how we all feel, right? We all feel like, oh my life could be so much better. It could be worse too. So the key conflict in Everything Everywhere All at Once is that Jobu Topaki, or Joy, is the abandoned daughter, again childhood abandonment, she goes on a quest of revenge against her absent demanding mother. So it's long been held that our view of the gods are a reflection of our view of our parents. Our parents are our deities when we're little, they provide everything, they provide guidance, structure, judgment, punishment, whatever. Right? And so childhood rejection and rebelling against the authority of parents is normal, but in this case it goes to an extreme level because in another universe, Evelyn pushed her daughter too far. And so Joy, or Jobu Topaki, gains these crazy superpowers and she is on a quest to get back to her mother. So the mother archetype is an incredibly powerful mythic archetype. We'll get into that in another story. At the end, as everything is coming apart, Joy has created the nihilism bagel the everything bagel and It isn't in enjoy it or jobu. Topaki is close to achieving her goal of absolute revenge and destroying everything and Evelyn has a choice. She has a choice near the end where all of Jobu, topaki's henmen, they have some pain that is driving them. Whether it's, you know, the loss of a wife or some injustice that they suffered or some other unmet need. And so there's this montage scene where Evelyn sees and acknowledges the pain that all the henchmen have and she gives them what they need. She makes them whole again and so basically she reacts to the pain that's driving the violence with love and she gives them what they need and she acknowledges that she was not there for her daughter and she makes a choice to say I love you and that's all that matters. That's all that matters now. So Evelyn has a very profound growth arc. And just before that final scene, sorry, I'll try and get through this without crying. Waymond, her husband says, and this is in one of the multiverses, the one where Evelyn is basically Michelle Yeoh, her real life persona where she's a movie star, and Wayman is a successful businessman, they're outside in an alley and Wayman's having a cigarette, and Wayman says, you know, in another life, I'm not going to make it through it, sorry, I would have been happy just running a laundromat with you. And so the lesson here is we get one life so we should make it count. And again love and connection is what we actually need. We don't need the gods, we don't need wealth, we don't even need a multiverse to explain away our existence. We just need each other. So thank you for watching and keep asking questions. other.
