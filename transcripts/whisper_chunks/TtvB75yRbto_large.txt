{"text": " I know, I've been gone for a very long time. No! And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult 10 years. I'm not gonna take you through all the agony I've been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might have seen. I don't know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline, Dave Chappelle drunk on stage in Detroit. Well, if you saw it, I wasn't drunk. I had smoked some reefer. With some rappers. Yeah. I don't know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong. Stronger than what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. There was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that's all it was. Two puffs? I never had that happen. I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, I'm gonna bomb, nigga. I can feel it. And that guy called my name Dave Chappelle. Niggas was like, ooh. You know, normally when you do a comedy show, you guys don't know what it looks like up here, but niggas be looking up at you like. That's how the show started. Didn't take long for their faces to switch up like, what the fuck? They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn't doing good. I don't remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It's a black lady with a Ford motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly, fuck you Deshapelle. I said, excuse me? She said, I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks. And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. Yeah! The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, we want our money back, we want our money back. I said, oh shit. I snapped out of it. Good people of Detroit. I said, I'm gonna go back, we want our money back. I said, oh shit, I snapped out of it. Good people of Detroit, hear me, hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back. Fuck that. I said, I'm like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn't promise this shit would be good. Boo, they said, fuck you. This went on for a long time. And then after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show, thousands of dollars. I said, I'm gonna give this to charity. You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night because not only did I bomb, nigga, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare. That would be like if you were having sex with a woman and for some reason, this would never happen, but for some reason, she had a mouse trap in her pussy. And get caught in the trap. And then you gotta fuck her again tomorrow night. I'd still do it but I'd be careful the next time. The old mouse trap in the pussy trick eh? Fool me once. We've already been through it like Michael Jackson. Remember when they said all that shit about Michael Jackson? They never proved anything till this dying day. But they said that he did some very heinous things. And one time I watched a documentary about it. They were talking about all this shit Michael Jackson allegedly did and as they were saying all these allegations, started showing pictures of his home, Neverland Ranch. You ever seen Michael Jackson's house on television? Well, the short of it is there's a lot of things for kids to do with that place. And I saw the whole thing, exotic animals and Ferris wheels and merry-go-rounds and shit, and the more they showed it, the more certain I was that I don't think Michael Jackson did any of those things they said he did. The house didn't look sexual. It looked like he was flossing on those motherfuckers. It didn't look like he was trying to fuck kids. It looked like he was just trying to impress them, like, this nigga's Jay-Z for kids. Like, he's just walking through his house. This is my cotton candy machine. It makes three tons of cotton candy a day. You know, all the cotton candy you want. This closet is filled with nothing but custom-made karate slippers. Isn't that cool? All the cotton candy you want. This closet is filled with nothing but custom-made karate slippers. Isn't that cool? Shall I have my monkey bring us more cupcakes? Hey guys, just watching a movie. What movie do you want to see? Home Alone. Oh no, no, don't touch the DVD player. McCullough Calkins here, he can act it out. Come on McCullough. Act out Home Alone for Oh, no, no, don't touch the DVD player. McCullough Calkins here. He can act it out. Come on, McCullough. Act out Home Alone for my guests. And them kids was like, Man, you were all right, mister. This is fantastic, man. We had you all wrong. Yeah. All wrong? What? I don't understand. What do you mean? Huh? Oh, well, you know, man, we thought it was gonna be the usual. Like, you're gonna have us come over and give us some wine cooler and, you know, suck our dicks. What? Suck your d- Ugh, you faggot ass kids. Nobody trying to suck your dick, nigga. I was trying to show you a better life. Bubbles, get these kids the fuck out of my house. You're just like everyone else. Hollywood is no place for moral absolutism. You know what I mean? We must never forget that R. Kelly peed on a 15-year-old girl. And he also wrote, I Believe I Can Fly. Same guy, same lifetime. If I showed you that video of him peeing on that girl and scored it to I Believe I Can Fly, he'd be torn. \u266a I used to think that I could not go on \u266a You wouldn't know how to feel. \u266a If I can see it \u266a It's okay, my career ended many years ago. She's just like, you need to stop doing that. And then I started to change the subject. How's school going boys and my son's tell me well, we didn't have school today technically my what what's going on? He said well, there was like a school shooting drill. I never heard of this. You know what this is They have drills that they make kids do Where they practice what to do if somebody comes to shoot up their school. I'd never heard that before. I was like, what the fuck? Then I had to tell my sons the truth. I don't want to tell him this shit son Son listen to me Fuck that drill Somebody comes to your school and wants to shoot it up. I'm just gonna be honest with you You probably gonna get shot nigga, I'm just being real I'm going to be honest with you. You probably going to get shot, nigga. I'm just being real. You got a famous dad. I talk a lot of shit. They going to be gunning for you, little buddy. Just stay low and run in a zigzag pattern and don't try to save anybody, son. Do you understand me? Do you understand me? If you're a parent, this shit is terrifying. This shit is real scary. All the parents is looking at each other crazy because we know as parents that one of us is raising the shooter. Just don't know which one of us it is. All we know for sure is that if you're a white parent, the chances that it's you, exponentially higher than the rest of us. It's fucking crazy. You know, I hated school too. It never occurred to me. Kill everybody in school. It's fucking crazy. Just do what I did, nigga. Try some things. Have you skipped school, nigga? Skip school. Take a walk and meet some other kids. Fuck school, nigga. You know what I said? That's all I said. First of all, I'll tell you right now what I said, and I will tell you that this was not a joke. It's a true story, and I just happened to tell it. All right, what happened was, I went to a gallery party, all right? I don't know who in here has ever been rich before, but these are very nice parties. You know, wine and cheese and ball of conversation. And there was a few eccentric types, one of which was a very wealthy man that happened to be wearing a dress. I don't know what you call them, man. A tranny or a drag queen, perhaps. Whatever it was, this was definitely a man. And this man was definitely on drugs. I don't know what kind of drugs he was on, but I knew he had too much. He didn't look good. He's like this, he's like, ah. He looked sick, and all his friends were standing around him, concerned, trying to revive him. I don't know whether, it looked like some kind of gay CPR, there was fanning and shit. There was like. I saw all this from a distance. Now, I should've minded my own business, but I got curious. I was like, uh... And I went over there. All I said, I said, excuse me, gentlemen, gentlemen, is he okay? And then they looked at me like I was evil. Oh. She is fine. I said, word? Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't know this is what we were doing. She is fine. Say word? Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't know this is what we were doing. Um... Here's my thing. I would support anybody's right to be whoever they feel like they are inside. I'm your ally in that. However... my question is, to what degree do I have to participate in your self-image? Is it fair that I have to change my whole pronoun game up for this motherfuckin'-? That doesn't make sense. Seriously. If I put on an Argyle sweater and I'm like, Hey, everybody, I feel like a white guy in this sweater and I want some goddamn respect and a bank loan. That's not gonna work. Give a fuck how I feel. Why don't I give a fuck how you feel? Nigger is a pronoun. But there was no time for a philosophical debate. This was an emergency situation. I said, fine. Sorry, guys. I was just worried because, because she looks terrible. She just fell off the bench. Appears that her dick is popping out of her dress. I'm out of a call an ambulance champ. I'd rather not be at a party where a tranny ODs there's too many questions to answer. laughter cheers applause I said, I'm in the wrong business. I should be the president. I said, I'm in the wrong business. See, the only reason I don't want to be president is because I'm black. That would make it too hot for me. I mean, you know what I mean. I think I could be a black president one day but you don't want to be the first one I mean second or third that's fine but that first nigga better watch out I'm gonna tell you that right now. Too hot. I mean I'd be the first black president I don't think that nobody would really really hurt me I'm sure somebody want to hurt me but I don't think they touch me because Because my vice president will be Mexican for a little insurance. You know what I'm saying? You can shoot me if you want, but you're just going to open the border up, so. Might as well leave me and Vice President Santiago to our own devices. Ain't that right, Santiago? Si! Si! Elian can stay. Don't worry, don't worry, I don't got no Elian jokes. All I'll say about Elian is thank God he's Cuban. Because if he was Haitian, you would have never heard about his ass. Thank you. If Elion Gonzales was Elion Mamumbo from Haiti, they'd have pushed that little rubber tube right back in the water. Sorry, fella, all full. Good luck. Later push a little rubber tube right back in the water. Sorry, fella Whole world is drug infested hate infested drug infested world hate drugs I heard the worst drugs three know my friend told me you know what he's dealing with His landlord is hooked on crack. That's that's terrible That's terrible. There's pressure. Your landlord's hooked on crack, that means you've gotta have the rent. You come around, I'll go, I got the rent. It's not even due yet, it's the 10th. Come on, I need it. Let me just get $20 of it now and then, just give me the rest of the other month. Every couple hours. Hey, look, I'm gonna need some more of the rent. Building's falling apart. Things came up. Comes home early from a party. Landlord's in the crib going through his shit. What are you doing in my house? Ah! Where's the sink? I came to fix it. It's in the kitchen. I thought it was in the drawer. I'll fix it tomorrow when I come for the rent. You know what I hate about drugs? I hate when like people my age and older get hooked on crack. I hate that shit. You're too old to be experimenting with the drugs at a certain point. You should be past that. You ain't doing it by a certain point, you're just missing. Drugs are really for old people anyway. You 75, you've earned a right. Shit, if I was 75, I'd do coke, heroin, everything. I wouldn't give a fuck. I'd be walking down the street, they'll be like, boy, that old man is tripping. I'll be walking down the street, they'll be like, boy, that old man is tripping. I'll be walking down the street, they'll be like, boy, that old man is tripping. I'll be walking down the street, they'll be like, boy, that old man is tripping. I'll be walking down the street, they'll be like, boy, that old man is tripping. I'll be walking down the street, they'll be like, Can't do everything. Maybe weed. If you're gonna do something, do a little weed. Smoke some weed. Weed's not as bad as everything else. Weed is a background substance. I mean, you can smoke some herb and still function. You ain't crisp, but you'll function. Nothing higher than weed though. I made that mistake one time. I was at a party, some guy gave me some shit. He's like, here man, take this. It's fucking mushrooms. I took it, I forgot all about it, you know. Then a couple days later, I found that shit in my pocket. I'm thinking, why not? Because I'm thinking it's like weed, some background shit. I planned my whole day out like it was weed. I'll chew this shit up, then I'll go to the barber shop, get my hair cut, and then I'll see a movie. I chewed it up. So far, so good. Then I was in a barbershop, like an hour later. And it's funny, because I was just thinking to myself, I was like, Ooh, this stuff sucks. Tastes like an athlete's foot. I feel sick, but I'm not really high. Then I looked in the mirror. I saw the barber's reflection, man. It looked like, it looked like a big penis was cutting my head. I freaked out. I started talking to myself, Dave, calm down. You're on your own. It looked like a big penis was cutting my hair. I freaked out. I started talking to myself, Dave, calm down. You're on drugs. This is what drugs do. Okay, you know that there is no way that a penis can cut hair. But I started freaking out, man. that a penis can cut hair. But I started freaking out, man. I just couldn't take it anymore. I jumped out the chair, half my hair was cut. I didn't care. I didn't, I just gave a barber a handful of money. It was weird, the balls opened up. Anyway, I ran home, man. I ran home as fast as I could tripping tripping I looked at the clock it was 242 I was like damn 242 I gotta sober up I've never been this high this early I took a shower, I was still high. I said, maybe music will do the trick. I listened to every CD I had, I was still high. Exercise, that's what I'll do. I ran around the block four times, still high. Took a nap, woke up, fucked up. I looked at the clock, it was 2.43. I said, God damn! Scared to death of these police. I am, nigga. I got a police scanner. First money I got, this the first shit I went out, bought me a police scanner. I just listen to these motherfuckers before I go out. Just to make sure everything's cool. You hear shit on it calling all cars calling all cars be on the lookout for a black male between 4 7 and 6 8 staying in the crib tonight fuck that gotta work on that alibi for a minute every black person needs an alibi I do them impromptu joints. If I'm by myself and need help, I just open up the windows in the apartment, turn all the lights on, stop beating off, right in the window. Look at me! Hey, everybody look! It's me, Dave Chappelle, I'm crazy, I'm jerking off. Note the time, motherfuckers. It's 2.35, look at me, I'm jerking off in the window, 2.35. Comedian Dave Chappelle, it's June 10th. Note the time! That shit could save my life. Comedian Dave Chappelle's June 10th note, the time... ... that shit could save my life. Officer Dave Chappelle couldn't have done that. I saw him in his window masturbating from 2.35 to 2.37. I'm certain of it. He was standing on a clock and holding a calendar and today's paper. Fuck, I need an alibi. I can't be no celebrity. This shit is just the worst. I'm seeing it. I can see why. I see why stars are crazy, man. These motherfuckers. I went to Disney World with my kids, which is a big deal for me. I don't get to see my kids so much. I do Chappelle's show 20 hours a day. Sleep for like half an hour, raise my kids for 10, 20 minutes, and I go back to work. Now... This particular day, I got to hook up with the kids. We went to Disney World. Everybody at the park, fucking everybody. Hey! Hey! I'm Rick James, bitch! Hey, I'm Rick James, bitch! Hey, I'm Rick James, bitch. It's like, hey, man, hey, you mind not calling me a bitch in front of my kids? Time out, motherfucker. We take a day off. Even Mickey Mouse did it. I said, this is the most unprofessional shit I have ever seen in my life. Rick James, bitch! Oh! Oh, I was fed up. I caught that motherfucker with the uppercut. Bop! Knocked his head clean off. Everybody was screaming. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Mickey Mouse is Mexican Small talks in a big world full of people With good vibes and bad habits Why I want to share this story with you because it's important to this point I Want you community to know that one of the coolest people I ever met Was transgender woman and this is not a man that I knew that became a woman this woman was Trans when I met her live in San Francisco Daphne Dorman is her name. I would do 18 shows in the Bay Area, sometimes in Oakland, and Dirty Hood nightclub, and she would be there, white trans woman, laughing loud and hard at everything I said, especially the trans jokes, very puzzling. Because she was obviously trans. And one night after one of the shows I met her. And what it was, turns out, it was her dream to be a comedian. And I was her hero. It's very moving. I could not dislike somebody that felt that way about me. We became fast friends And when I made that special sticks and stones right as it was coming out I happened to be in San Francisco and I wanted to do a show but I needed an opening act and I remembered That trans woman I had met so I called her on the phone And I called her myself. I said hey Daphne this is Dave Chappelle. She couldn't believe it. And I go, I'm in San Francisco. And then she started saying a bunch of wild stuff. I was like, relax, man. I don't want any pussy. I was, um... I was calling because I'm doing a show and I need an opening act. And I was wondering if you'd open the show. And she was like, fuck yeah. Now, I didn't know this at the time, but this woman had only done stand-up comedy eight times in her life. This is little to no experience. And now she's about to open a show for what many call The Goat. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. She's an amateur in stature, but in practice she was very professional. She showed up early, which is something I appreciate because I like people to be on time. She was dressed to the motherfucking nines. I mean, I'm transphobic and even I was like you look nice Went up on the stage with all the swag of a professional comedian grabbed that mic and walked right down the middle and looked at The crowd like a gangster man. You should have seen her work bitch bomb for 45 minutes straight And I am NOT exaggerating young man that show was terrible stunk stunk and then she brings me on and you know you know I was like a glass of water after a handful of salt the crowd was happy to see me I was killing it but here's what impressed me any other comedian I've ever seen, if they had bombed as bad as she did, would have snuck out of the back of the theater and went home and cried or something. She didn't do that. Not only did she not leave, she found a seat right up in front. You know, when a new comedian watches an experienced comedian in comedy, we call this taking class. And this bitch took my whole class she sat up there and Was laughing as hard as she always laughs as if nothing bad had even happened to her and I saw her show Something bad happened to her She was drunk So she starts talking to me while I'm on stage But the way a person would talk to a television when they were alone. She's talking to me like that. That didn't bother me because I knew her, but the crowd didn't like that shit at all because she sucked. And a guy in the back of the room stood up, and Daphne's hair was dyed blonde at the time, and the guy screamed out, and his energy felt wild as fuck. He said, hey Daphne! And everybody kind of clamp a clamp that got tense we didn't know it was a heckler active shooter and He said he said does the carpet match the drapes Yeah, it was fucked up the whole crowd kind of grown because it was so like mean was fucked up. The whole crowd kind of groaned because it was so like mean. Everybody groaned except for Daphne. She would kind of laughed which was weird and then she didn't even look all the way back. She said, sir I don't have carpets I have hardwood floors. Just like that. Just like that. Boy when she said that shit it blew the roof off the place. Cut through all the tension with that one joke she made up for 45 minutes of a stinker of a show. And after that she could do no wrong. And I kept on rocking, she kept on talking to me, and then the show became something cooler than a show. It became like a conversation between a black man and a white trans woman, and we started getting to the bottom of shit. All them questions that you think about that you'd be afraid to ask, I was just asking them, and she was answering them, and her answers were funny as shit. The crowd was falling out of their chairs, and at the end of the show, I go, oh, Daphne, I said, well, that was fun. I go, I love you to death, but I have no fucking idea what you're talking about the whole crowd left except for Daphne Now she looks at me like I'm not her friend anymore Like I'm something bigger than me like I'm the whole world and the guy and she said I don't need you to understand me I said what? She said I just need you to understand me. I said, what? She said, I just need you to believe, just like this, she goes, that I'm having a human experience. And when she said it, the whole crowd kind of gasped. And I gave it a Fight Club look. I said, I believe you, bitch. Because she didn't say anything about pronouns. She didn't say anything about me being in trouble. She said, just believe I'm a person and I'm going through it. I said, oh, I believe you because it takes one to know one. And then I told the crowd goodnight and they start going crazy. And before the applause gets to its crescendo, I say, and don't forget my opening act, Daphne. And the crowd stood up and I looked at her and tears came out of her eyes. She couldn't believe it was happening. I couldn't believe it was happening because her show stunk. And it was a great night. I remember the late great Paul Mooney was there, a bunch of fly ass comedy niggas was there. And we all went backstage and was just drinking and talking shit and laughing and daffing. They stole the room. She had everyone cracking up, spinning the yarn, telling us all these crazy stories about shit she be into. We all laughing real hard. And then she's telling us and everyone's laughing. I'm looking around, I'm like, oh my God, she is funny. I pulled her aside and I said, you're hilarious. I didn't know that when you were on stage I Said you're doing some things wrong, but I can help you I said anytime. I'm in San Francisco Why don't you open the show for me, and I'll just try to give you some pointers See if you can't work this thing out. She said are you serious? Cuz again, and she grabbed me real tight hug me squeeze And I pushed her off violently cuz I'm transphobic. I said boundaries bitch! When Sticks and Stones came out a lot of people in the trans community were furious with me and apparently they dragged me on Twitter I don't give a fuck cuz Twitter is not a real place And the hardest thing for a person to do is go against their tribe if they disagree with their tribe But Daphne did that for me She wrote a tweet that was very beautiful when she said was there's almost exactly what she said She said punching down on someone requires you to think less of them, and I know him and he doesn't He doesn't punch up. He doesn't punch down. He punches lines, and he's a master at his craft. That's what she said. Beautiful tweet. Beautiful friend. It took a lot of heart to defend me like that. And when she did that, the trans community dragged that bitch all over Twitter. For days, they was going in on her, and she was holding her own because she's funny. But six days after that wonderful night I described to you, my friend Daphne killed herself. Oh yeah, it's a true story, my heart was broken. Yeah, it wasn't the jokes. I don I don't know if was them dragging. I don't know what's going on in her life But I bet dragging her didn't help. I Was very angry at them. I was very angry at her. I Felt like Daphne lied to me She always says she identified as a woman and then one day she goes up to the roof of a building and jumps off and kills herself. Clearly, only a man would do some gangster shit like that. Hear me out. As hard as it is to hear a joke like that, I'm telling you right now, Daphne would have loved that joke. That's why she was my friend. I was reading her obituary and I found out she was survived by a daughter. And the moment I found that out, and this is true, Anderson Cooper from CNN texted me. And all he said was very nice. He He said I'm sorry to hear about your friend, and I text him right back new phone who this He said it's Anderson Cooper I said oh I said Anderson I go look I need to find her family And he texted me right back with all the phone numbers and all this information I say this to say if you ever want to know about anything gay Call Anderson Cooper from CNN. This nigga's faster than Google. What I did is I got in touch with a family and I started a trust fund for her daughter because I know that's all she ever really cared about. And I don't know what the trans community did for her, but I don't care, because I feel like she wasn't their tribe. She was mine. She was a comedian in her soul. Your daughter is very young, but I hope to be alive when she turns 21 because I'm going to give her this money myself.
