{"text": " I have compiled the definitive list of AI YouTube personalities. Nah, just kidding. It's like super highly subjective. No, these are just like all the AI YouTubers that I like, follow, and kind of wish I was friends with. There is a completely underrated YouTuber that you need to know about. And this crazy green genius is at the top of my list. Ting ting in. Like he is a character, but he's so smart and so deep and so thoughtful about all of his videos. Like he looks like he might be AI or cartoon, but he's so smart and so deep and so thoughtful about all of his videos. Like he looks like he might be AI or cartoon but he's not. He's real and he's on a whole nother level. When he made this video which is I've taken video deepfakes to a whole nother level there was like no project out there. He had to write the code and put it on github. Then he explains it super well and like edits like a madman. Like I know how hard that editing is. And he's like the first one to walk me through Dreambooth. He just does great stuff. It's literally no fluff. It's all just like, wow, this is important. If you're into AI, this guy deserves your sub. Look, if you want a super smart AI hardware chick, Anastasia from Anastasia in Tech is who you should subscribe to. She covers super technical topics in a way that's totally easy to understand. She's a professional chip designer in Australia, and she breaks down some real research papers that has real applications to the AI that we know and love. Computer science, electrical engineering, it's a good combo. Okay, so let's rank your videos by popularity. New IBM breakthrough explained, new Tesla Dojo supercomputer explained, why future computers are gonna be entirely different. Guess, because of that little alien in the background? Is this a quantum computer thing? I don't get it, but it makes me want to click. So if you love AI, but you're not totally up on neuromorphic chips, then subscribe to her channel. So if you're interested in artificial intelligence, sometimes you don't want to read a long research paper. You just want a friend to go out there and explore all the new tools and show you what they found. So if that's the kind of YouTuber that you're looking for, you've got to check out MatProVid AI. So even though I've kind of dabbled and loved artificial intelligence for years, it wasn't until I found this channel about eight months ago that was moving from Minecraft over to artificial intelligence. And then it dawned on me like it's about time where AI is now out there in the world and there's so many products to cover that it might start intriguing people in a way that would make it relevant for YouTube.

She's really playful with everything she makes. Like she challenges ChatGPT in very interesting ways. Like she's got like a psychology aspect to how she makes her videos. For example like this one, testing latest AI gone wrong moments. Or I'd turn GPT-4 into a brutally honest assistant. Let's check out her most popular videos. Oh yeah, make money with ChatGPT. There was like a moment where everybody was doing that.
