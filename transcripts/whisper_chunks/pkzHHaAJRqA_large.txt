{"text": " We're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico! We're going to California and Texas and New York! And we're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan! And then we're going to Washington, D.C. to take back the White House! Yeah! Never gets old. If you're wondering why we just came back from break with that viral clip of Howard Dean from 2004, it's because the former Vermont governor reprised the infamous moment last night at the convention. Take a listen. This race is going to be won on the ground, and it's going to be won in Colorado and in Iowa and North Carolina and Michigan and Florida and Pennsylvania and then we're going to the White House. So clearly he's gotten over it and also he looks way younger now than he did back in 2004. I don't know what's going on with the hair there, Governor. The crowd went wild for Governor Dean. The original Dean scream was so popular, it even prompted a skit on the revered sketch comedy show, Chappelle's Show. Too bad we can't show you that because it is absolutely awesome, but it didn't propel Dean to success. He came in third at the Democratic Iowa caucuses.", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 6.0], "text": " We're going to South Carolina and Oklahoma and Arizona and North Dakota and New Mexico!"}, {"timestamp": [6.0, 9.0], "text": " We're going to California and Texas and New York!"}, {"timestamp": [9.0, 14.0], "text": " And we're going to South Dakota and Oregon and Washington and Michigan!"}, {"timestamp": [14.0, 17.0], "text": " And then we're going to Washington, D.C. to take back the White House!"}, {"timestamp": [17.0, 19.0], "text": " Yeah!"}, {"timestamp": [20.0, 22.0], "text": " Never gets old."}, {"timestamp": [22.0, 27.76], "text": " If you're wondering why we just came back from break with that viral clip of Howard Dean from 2004,"}, {"timestamp": [27.76, 34.44], "text": " it's because the former Vermont governor reprised the infamous moment last night at the convention.
