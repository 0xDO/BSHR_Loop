{"text": " Speaking of your YouTube videos, in one of your popular videos, you discuss how AI can create a post-scarcity leisure class where corporations can produce more with less. So let's talk about that in the context of business systems and ERP if we can. And so my first question is, how can AI redefine ERP and other business systems, particularly in the context of increasing productivity and reducing workforce? Yeah, to provide a little bit of context to color my answer is my career was in IT infrastructure. So I viewed ERP from kind of the substrate, you know, underneath all the technology supporting ERP systems. So if my answers are a little off color, that's why it's because I'm coming from a slightly different school of thought. But from a technology standpoint, most organizations are highly, highly dependent upon, obviously, the human element, the workers, but then the technology that the workers interact with, whether it's business automation, workflow automation, data, billing, there's all kinds of domains that all touch technology. And what I suspect we're going to start seeing first, because, you know, some of these technologies are being deployed, but we're at the very, very tip of the iceberg. And so one of the things that I predict we'll see first is anything that integrates with an API. And of course, a lot of ERP systems and other business software systems all have APIs. So we're gonna see basic Office productivity first with Office 365 Co-Pilot and Bing Enterprise kind of coming down the pipeline. But not long after that, from an ERP perspective, from an enterprise perspective, you're gonna start to see probably semi-autonomous AI tools entering into that space, which is basically just going to be an extra tool in the toolbox for existing employees. Over time, however, and this I expect will actually ramp up pretty quickly with some variance. Obviously, some things require human judgment. Some things require a licensed human to make a decision. You might need a CPA or a lawyer to make certain judgment calls. But with that being said, we're going to see a lot more piecemeal automation. And that's going to get scraped together over time to get to fully autonomous automation. It's difficult to have a timeline on any of these things, but a lot of the underlying technical capacity is there, especially with some of the latest generative AI models. Several of them, Gorilla is the name of it, is trained to access 10,000 different APIs right out of the box. So already you have a tremendous amount of capability, but it takes time to integrate, it takes time to test, and it takes time to make sure that you do these things correctly and you don't harm the business, right? It's all about the bottom line. That's kind of my initial thoughts as to where generative AI is gonna take the ERP trajectory. Fascinating, David. I love your response. And so speaking of harming the business, do you have any thoughts on this question? What changes do you foresee in financial systems and policies and regulations due to AI and how might this impact ERP structures or business systems in general? Yeah, that's a great question. You know, so the prevailing wisdom right now, and you see this in regulation talks, particularly in the European Union. There's some talk about this in the United States as well. The idea is that human in the loop, human in the loop, that's the drumbeat that they're beating, which is basically that no matter how autonomous any of these AI systems become, that there should be a person making a decision. Of course, in any business automation tool or platform, you usually have checkpoints where it's like, okay, you need a human approval. In that respect, I think that there's not going to be a whole heck of a lot of difference moving forward. However, what I think we're going to find is that some of those bottlenecks, you're basically going to end up with people that their primary role is just kind of rubber stamping decisions or suggestions that the machine is making, and then you get decision fatigue. And so decision fatigue, organizational psychologists will be familiar with this, but basically, anytime an employee has to make a decision, it kind of costs a little bit of their mental steam for the day. And if you're making repetitive decisions, eventually you just kind of get lazier and lazier. And that's not an indictment of people, but your brain just gets tired and you kind of start choosing shorthand. And so, in terms of how regulations are going to play out, financial regulations are going to play out, but then also harming the business. I think we're quickly going to discover that machines are going to be much more reliable at making some kinds of decisions. And this is some of the work and experiments that I've done where sure, you know, if any of your audience is familiar and they, you plug in, you know, chat GPT and you ask it for an answer and it'll kind of barf out an answer that may or may not be any good, there are things that you can do with these to check itself, to check its own work or have a system of checks to make sure that the work that it thinks that it's doing is good. What I suspect the first big bottleneck is going to be is going to be that, okay, well, if the machine is \u2013 it's like running on a treadmill, right? The treadmill is going to keep going whether or not the human's on it. These autonomous and semi-autonomous generative AI tools that are going to be throughout the organization, they're going to be able to keep running whether or not the human is even awake at the wheel. Trains have a dead man button where every five minutes you have to push a button to make sure that the train operator is still awake. And I think that we're gonna see a few problems there because, and we've already seen this with Zillow, for instance, where they used AI to put in bids for a lot of property and they ended up buying way too much property and driving up the price of real estate in some of the markets that they were operating in. Why? Because there was no human oversight. And so that \u2013 I don't know how it's going to play out, but that is where I see kind of the first big hurdle in terms of, okay, how do we implement these technologies in order to, of course, increase productivity without unintended consequences like driving up your prices or making bad \u2013 otherwise just any kind of bad decisions automatically. productivity without unintended consequences like, you know, driving up your prices or making bad, otherwise just any kind of bad decisions automatically.", "chunks": [{"timestamp": [0.0, 4.24], "text": " Speaking of your YouTube videos, in one of your popular videos,"}, {"timestamp": [4.24, 8.2], "text": " you discuss how AI can create a post-scarcity leisure class"}, {"timestamp": [8.2, 10.74], "text": " where corporations can produce more with less."}, {"timestamp": [11.0, 15.18], "text": " So let's talk about that in the context of business systems and ERP if we can."}, {"timestamp": [15.54, 19.44], "text": " And so my first question is, how can AI redefine ERP"}, {"timestamp": [19.44, 22.38], "text": " and other business systems, particularly in the context"}, {"timestamp": [22.38, 25.6], "text": " of increasing productivity and reducing workforce?"}, {"timestamp": [25.6, 32.72], "text": " Yeah, to provide a little bit of context to color my answer is my career was in IT infrastructure."}, {"timestamp": [32.72, 38.72], "text": " So I viewed ERP from kind of the substrate, you know, underneath all the technology supporting"}, {"timestamp": [38.72, 43.44], "text": " ERP systems.
